Farleigh Hungerford Castle, sometimes called Farleigh Castle or Farley Castle, is a medieval castle in Farleigh Hungerford, Somerset, England. The castle was built in two phases: the inner court was constructed between 1377 and 1383 by Sir Thomas Hungerford, who made his fortune working as a steward to John of Gaunt. The castle was built to a quadrangular design, already slightly old-fashioned, on the site of an existing manor house overlooking the River Frome. A park was attached to the castle, requiring the destruction of a local village. His son, Sir Walter Hungerford, a successful knight and courtier to Henry V, became rich during the Hundred Years War with France and extended the castle with an additional, outer court, enclosing the parish church in the process. By Walter's death in 1449, the substantial castle was richly appointed and its chapel decorated with murals.\n\nQUESTION: What was the title of the man who Sir Thomas Hungerford made his fortune working as a steward to?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

Hughes wanted young black writers to be objective about their race, but not to scorn it or flee it. He understood the main points of the Black Power movement of the 1960s, but believed that some of the younger black writers who supported it were too angry in their work. Hughes\'s work "Panther and the Lash", posthumously published in 1967, was intended to show solidarity with these writers, but with more skill and devoid of the most virulent anger and racial chauvinism some showed toward whites. Hughes continued to have admirers among the larger younger generation of black writers. He often helped writers by offering advice and introducing them to other influential persons in the literature and publishing communities. This latter group, including Alice Walker, whom Hughes discovered, looked upon Hughes as a hero and an example to be emulated within their own work.

Ebenezer Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), the Victorian proprietor of a "moustache shop", is the nicest man in England. He is everything that Ebenezer Scrooge was by the end of the original story: generous and kind to everybody, and sensitive to the misery of others. As a result, people take advantage of his kindness—Mrs. Scratchit and an orphan take all his money, and a beadle takes his food. All but Mr. Baldrick (Tony Robinson) view him as a victim. His business turns no profit, all his earnings going to charity and to con artists, and he lives a lonely, miserable life.\n---\nPassage 2: Blackadder\'s Christmas Carol .

Francesco noted that "there are numerous musical highpoints on the album that will help it to standout [sic] from the pack. Lyrically, though, it\'s pretty much the standard fare", but the album "more than accomplishes what it set out to accomplish." Lastly, Francesco found that "Citizens manage to find a workable balance between catchy pop music and uplifting praise and worship." Cross Rhythms\' Josh Dipple found that the release "can\'t be faulted for its energy, with songs that long to be played to big crowds at summer festivals, played expertly by a band who have obviously been studiously taking notes, watching the likes of Kings Of Leon and The Strokes."\n---\nPassage 2: ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival .

Valverde led the first organised scientific expedition to the Donana in 1957, joined by the British naturalists Guy Mountfort, Roger Peterson, and Sir Julian Huxley. A group of European conservation experts – including Guy Monfort, Max Nicholson and Luc Hoffmann –then demonstrated the crucial importance of the area as a stopover for birds migrating between the European and African continents. In 1959, the Gonzalez family sold part of their land in Doñana for development of the Matalascañas resort. This alarmed European conservationists, leading various institutions and anonymous donors to offer to buy part of the property. Valverde, Hoffman, and Nicholson, in partnership with the British Nature Conservancy, formed an association that organised an international drive for funds to expand the park. The campaign raised two million Swiss Francs to buy 7,000 hectares of land for annexation to that already donated by González-Gordon. Finally, in 1963 the Spanish government and WWF bought part of the territory and created the first Doñana preserve, and in 1964 they established the Doñana Biological Station and the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas - CSIC) to study the biodiversity of Doñana and other Spanish ecosystems. In 1969, the WWF again joined forces with the Spanish government to purchase another section of the Guadalquivir Delta marshes and establish the Doñana National Park. That same year the Doñana National Park was created by decree, part of whose territory was owned by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad) and part still in private hands. Ten years later the protected area was expanded and the so-called "Preparque Doñana" was created. In 1980, UNESCO recognised the Doñana National Park as a Biosphere Reserve of 77,260 hectares. The Core Zone consists of 50,720 hectares in the National Park of Doñana. The buffer zone is 54,250 hectares in the Natural Park of Doñana. The altitude ranges from sea level to 40 meters above sea level. Unesco considers Doñana of world significance, based on the variety of its ecosystems and the wide number of species they harbor. In 1982 it was included in the list of wetlands of the Ramsar Convention, and in 1989 the Regional Government of Andalusia converted the Preparque into the Doñana Natural Park. In 1994 it was listed by Unesco as a World Heritage Site, enabling the establishment of programs to preserve and manage the area. Historically, these vital wetlands have been constantly threatened by schemes to increase local agricultural output and tourism. WWF still supports the Doñana, and is fighting proposals to drain the marshes and syphon off water for irrigation of agricultural land along the coast and expansion of tourist facilities.\n---\nPassage 2: Doñana National Park . Doñana National Park has a biodiversity that is unique in Europe, although there are some similarities to the Parc Naturel Régional de Camargue of the Camargue river delta in France, with which Doñana Park is twinned. The park features a great variety of ecosystems and shelters wildlife including thousands of European and African migratory birds, fallow deer, Spanish red deer, wild boars, European badgers, Egyptian mongooses, and endangered species such as the Spanish imperial eagle and the Iberian lynx.\n\nQUESTION: Which park is larger of the two, Doñana National Park or Timanfaya National Park?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user's question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

Nguyễn Văn Trỗi (1 February 1940 – 15 October 1964) was a Việt Cộng (National Liberation Front) bomber. He gained notoriety after being captured by South Vietnamese forces while trying to assassinate United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and future ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. who were visiting South Vietnam in May 1963.\n---\nPassage 2: 1964 in the Vietnam War . Nguyễn Văn Trỗi was executed by firing squad in South Vietnam. A Vietnamese electrical worker and Viet Cong urban guerrilla, he was captured after trying to assassinate Secretary of Defense McNamara and future ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. who were visiting South Vietnam, in May 1963. Troi was the first publicly executed Viet Cong.\n---\nPassage 3: Nguyễn Văn Trỗi . Trỗi was glorified by the Việt Cộng and North Vietnam as a martyr. The first notable act of recognition was in 1965 when the DRVN issued a postage stamp, illustrated on the right, bearing a portrait of him. Considered an exemplar, Trỗi has his name bestowed upon a large school, the "Lycée Nguyễn Văn Trỗi" in Nha Trang, and a national academic award, "The Nguyễn Văn Trỗi Prize".\n\nQUESTION: Nguyễn Văn Trỗi tried to assassinate a future ambassador from which US state ?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

"Twenty Two" is episode 53 of the American television series "The Twilight Zone." The story was adapted by Rod Serling from a short anecdote in the 1944 Bennett Cerf Random House anthology "Famous Ghost Stories," which itself was an adaptation of "The Bus-Conductor," a short story by E. F. Benson published in "The Pall Mall Magazine" in 1906.\n---\nPassage 2: Twilight Zone literature . "Twilight Zone" literature is an umbrella term for the many books and comic books which concern or adapt "The Twilight Zone" television series. Gold Key Comics published a long-running "Twilight Zone" comic that featured the likeness of Rod Serling introducing both original stories and occasional adaptations of episodes. The comic outlived the television series by nearly 20 years and Serling by nearly a decade. A later revival of "Twilight Zone" comics was published by Now Comics, spinning off of the 1980s revival of the show.\n---\nPassage 3: The Twilight Zone (radio series) . Many of the stories are based on Rod Serling\'s scripts from the original "Twilight Zone" series, and are slightly expanded and updated to reflect contemporary technology and trends (e.g., the mention of "cell phones" and "CD-ROMs" which, of course, were not around when the television show aired in the 1960s). In addition to adapting all of the original episodes aired on the 1959-1964 TV series, the radio series has also adapted some "Twilight Zone" TV scripts which were never produced, scripts from other Serling TV productions, and new stories written especially for the radio series. Taking Serling\'s role as narrator is Stacy Keach. Different Hollywood actors, such as Blair Underwood and James Caviezel, take the lead role in each radio drama. In addition, several stars who appeared on the original TV series, such as H.M. Wynant, Orson Bean and Morgan Brittany, appear, although purposely not in the roles they originated on television. The series features a full cast, music and sound effects and is produced in the flavor of classic radio dramas but using today\'s technology. In addition to being an homage to the original "Twilight Zone" TV series (in many cases using the original music), the radio dramas pay tribute to the era of classic radio drama, including allusions to radio dramas such as "Gunsmoke", the presence of radio legend Stan Freberg in many episodes, and the sons of radio drama personalities Stacy Keach, Sr., (director, "Tales of the Texas Rangers") and Ed Begley, Sr., (actor, "Richard Diamond, Private Detective") as stars in the series.\n\nQUESTION: "Twenty Two" is an episode of the series "The Twilight Zone." adapted from an anecdote by a publisher who made appearance in what panel game show?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user's question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

The family is forced to inhabit an unusually small yet Earth-like planet, as they cannot return to Earth due to Rick\'s status as a wanted criminal. Rick turns himself into the Federation to allow his family to return home, and is incarcerated on a prison planet under the charges of having committed "everything". But in the season three premiere "The Rickshank Redemption", by taking out the Council of Ricks while saving Morty and Summer, it is revealed that Rick actually turned himself in to access the Federation\'s supercomputer and wipe it out financially. Rick also indirectly convinces Beth to divorce Jerry for trying to convince the family to sell him out.\n---\nPassage 3: Pilot (Rick and Morty) .

After the first two periods, the Canucks trailed 2–1. The Sharks scored quickly in the third period and by the 4:07 mark had scored three goals to make it a 5–1 game. After the fifth goal, Schneider was pulled and replaced by Luongo. Vancouver eventually lost the game 5–2, with Schneider making 23 saves on 28 shots. Luongo stopped all 10 shots he faced. In the post-game press conference, Schneider stated he felt good, but did not do enough to help out his teammates. Later, questions were raised about who would be the starter for Game 4. Luongo stated he would be ready if asked to play, but also stated he would be supportive of Schneider if he was the starter. Sharks\' centre Joe Thornton stated that San Jose felt Luongo had played great in the first two games, and they were lucky not to have to face him in Game 3. In Game 4, Schneider made the start and after two periods, the Canucks trailed 2–1. Midway through the third period, Vancouver had taken the lead, but late in the period, San Jose tied the game with a power play goal to force overtime. In the extra period, Daniel Sedin checked Tommy Wingels, which sent the Sharks winger\'s head into the boards. Sedin was given a controversial boarding penalty on the play. On the ensuing power play, San Jose scored to win the game and complete the series sweep. After the goal was scored, Daniel voiced his opinion of the call to the referees and was given a game misconduct penalty for abusive language. When asked about the call after the game, he replied, "It\'s the playoffs. It\'s shoulder to shoulder," and it was a bad call, though he further noted that the Canucks did not lose the series on the call. Brother Henrik noted that it was "a bullshit call" also pointing out that it was shoulder to shoulder. Referee Kelly Sutherland explained the call by stating he deemed it a violent shove into the boards where the player could not defend himself. For his part, Schneider made 43 saves on 47 shots in Game 4, he stated that he was 100% healthy and his groin injury was not a factor in his play.\n\nQUESTION: Did the board game San Marco or About Time come out first?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

The Con Mine (1938-2003) was the first gold mine developed in the Northwest Territories, Canada, just south of Yellowknife. The property was staked by Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada (Cominco) in September 1935 in response to the discovery of visible gold nearby; the name "Con" is an abbreviation of "Consolidated". The advent of winter prevented any prospecting from being conducted, but work in the summer of 1936 led to the discovery of numerous gold veins. The Con Mine entered production in 1938 and ceased operations in 2003. It has produced over of gold from 12,195,585 tons of ore processed. The mine was over deep.\n---\nPassage 2: Beaulieu Mine . The Beaulieu Mine was a post-World War II gold mining operation near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. It entered production in October 1947 but by the end of November only 7 troy ounces (220 g) of rough gold were recovered. Additional gold was recovered during 1948 but altogether the mine recovered only 30 troy ounces (930 g) of fine gold. The operation folded in chaos and bankruptcy.\n---\nPassage 3: Giant Mine . The discovery led to a massive post-war staking boom in Yellowknife. Giant Mine entered production in 1948 and ceased operations in 2004. It produced over of gold. Owners of the mine have included Falconbridge (1948–1986 through subsidiary Giant Yellowknife Mines Limited), Pamour of Australia (1986–1990 through subsidiary Giant Yellowknife Mines Limited), and Royal Oak Mines (1990–1999). When Royal Oak went bankrupt in 1999 the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND) took over responsibility for cleaning up the Giant mine site. Miramar Mining Corporation subsequently entered into an arrangement with the government whereby Miramar held the mine operation in care and maintenance, continued underground dewatering operations, and removed the remaining ore from underground for treatment at the nearby Con Mine process facility (1999–2004) .\n\nQUESTION: Which mine first entered into production, Beaulieu Mine or Con Mine?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user's question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

The 1983–84 New York Knicks season was the 38th season for the team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). In the regular season, the Knicks had a 47–35 record, and qualified for the NBA Playoffs as the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. New York was led by small forward Bernard King, who averaged 26.3 points per game (PPG) in the regular season and 34.8 PPG in the playoffs. In early 1984, King scored 50 points in consecutive games, against the San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Mavericks.\n---\nPassage 2: Bernard King . Bernard King (born December 4, 1956) is an American retired professional basketball player at the small forward position in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played 14 seasons with the New Jersey Nets, Utah Jazz, Golden State Warriors, New York Knicks and the Washington Bullets. He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on September 8, 2013. His younger brother, Albert, also played in the NBA during his career.\n---\nPassage 3: History of the New York Knicks . In the finals, the Knicks would play seven low-scoring, defensive games against the Houston Rockets. After splitting the first two games in Houston, the Knicks would win two out of three games at Madison Square Garden, which also hosted the New York Rangers first Stanley Cup celebration in 54 years following their win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of their finals during the series. (A Knicks win would have made the Garden the first building to host a Cup winner and an NBA champ in the same season.) In Game 6, however, a last-second attempt at a game-winning shot by Starks was tipped by Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon, giving the Rockets an 86–84 victory and forcing a Game 7. The Knicks lost Game 7 90–84, credited in large part to Starks's dismal 2-for-18 shooting performance and Riley's stubborn refusal to bench Starks, despite having bench players who were renowned for their shooting prowess, such as Rolando Blackman and Hubert Davis available. The loss denied New York the distinction of having both NBA and NHL championships in the same year. Nevertheless, the Knicks had gotten some inspiration from Mark Messier and the Rangers during the finals.\n\nQUESTION: Who played for the 1983–84 New York Knicks season and also had a younger brother who played in the NBA during his career\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>", "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user's question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

In the second chorus, he expresses his intention to reconcile with his wife and asks the other man to not interfere (possibly out of concern that the wife may continue the affair or at least not discourage his continued attention).

In chapter 4 ("The Terror of History") of "The Myth of the Eternal Return" and chapter 9 ("Religious Symbolism and the Modern Man\'s Anxiety") of "Myths, Dreams, and Mysteries", Eliade argues at length that the rejection of religious thought is a primary cause of modern man\'s anxieties.\n---\nPassage 3: Maggie Diaz .

His 1934 novel "Fer-de-Lance" introduced his best-known characters, detective Nero Wolfe and his assistant Archie Goodwin, who were featured in 33 novels and 39 novellas and short stories between 1934 and 1975. In 1959, Stout received the Mystery Writers of America\'s Grand Master Award. The Nero Wolfe corpus was nominated Best Mystery Series of the Century at Bouchercon XXXI, the world\'s largest mystery convention, and Rex Stout was nominated Best Mystery Writer of the Century.\n---\nPassage 4: Rocko\'s Modern Life . The writers aimed to create stories that they describe as "strong" and "funny". The writers, including George Maestri and Martin Olson, often presented ideas to Murray while eating hamburgers at Rocky\'s, a restaurant formerly located on Lankershim in the North Hollywood section of the San Fernando Valley. He took his team members on "writing trips" to places such as Rocky\'s, the La Brea Tar Pits, and the wilderness. If he liked the story premises, the writers produced full outlines from the premises. Outlines approved by both him and Nickelodeon became "Rocko\'s Modern Life" episodes. Maestri describes some stories as originating from "real life" and some originating from "thin air". Murray stated that each episode of "Rocko\'s Modern Life" stemmed from the personal experiences of himself and/or one or more of the directors or writers. He said that he did not intend to use formulaic writing seen in other cartoons; he desired content that "broke new ground" and "did things that rode the edge", and that could be described as "unexpected". He did not hire writers who had previous experience with writing cartoons, instead hiring writers who worked outside of animation, including improv actors and comic artists. He said that story concepts that "ever smacked close to some formula idea that we had all seen before" received immediate rejection.\n---\nPassage 5: Louis Amédée Achard . Achard was a prolific writer. In addition to his journalism, he wrote about thirty plays and about forty books. He is known today primarily for his cloak and dagger novels. Some incorrectly claim that he was the originator of the term (Ponson du Terrail used the term a little before him), but he did write a novel called "la Cape et l\'Épée" ("The Cloak and Dagger") in 1875. Achard also wrote many books on manners. He died, aged 60, in Paris.\n\nQUESTION: What did the American writer who wrote Into Thin Air  primarily known for in his writings \n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user's question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

Nicolás, after consulting with Pope Francis, determined to resign after his 80th birthday, and initiated the process of calling a Jesuit General Congregation to elect his successor. Until the resignation of his predecessor, Peter Hans Kolvenbach, it was not the norm for a Jesuit Superior General to resign; they, like the great majority of the Popes up until Benedict XVI, generally served until death. However, the Jesuit constitutions include provision for a resignation. In October 2016 the thirty-sixth General Congregation of the Society of Jesus appointed his successor, Arturo Sosa from Venezuela.\n---\nPassage 4: Carlo Odescalchi . In 1837, Odescalchi submitted to Pope Gregory XVI his resignation from all his offices to enter the Society of Jesus, but the Pope refused. Appointed Grand Prior of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in Rome, he again asked the Pope to accept his resignation, which Gregory did this time. After abdicating his cardinalate and episcopate in 1838, Odescalchi finally entered the Jesuit Order on 6 December; he took the habit on the following 8 December and professed his vows on 2 February 1840.\n---\nPassage 5: History of the papacy .

There are a lot of empty units due to stores closing down in the 2007 recession as there is only an 80% occupancy rate of Middleton Grange, with the new BHS store opening this will increase the occupancy rate to 86%. The majority of the empty units are located in the East Mall, Upper West Mall and Market Walk areas. The longest serving retail outlet since the opening is Boots, following the closure of Woolworths in 2009 and the pending closure of Marks & Spencer in 2015. The four anchor tenants are Marks & Spencer (until 2015), BHS, Wilko and Primark, There was fifth anchor tenant, The Co-operative Home Store and it closed in October 2011 leaving the large unit empty, the Eugene\'s Cafe at the bottom of the unit stayed open but closed in September 2012. That particular unit and the Primark unit were previously a supermarket housing Fine Fare, then Gateway and finally Asda until they closed and moved to new premises on Hartlepool Marina in 1996. In 2012 Brighthouse, Home Bargains, JD Sports and Sports Direct moved to larger units and Carphone Warehouse and Gamestation closed.

The band released their first album, "Highway Signs and Driving Songs", in 1995, surprisingly, without the help of a record label. The album was a roots rock fusion of country, rock, and folk. Despite its critical success, the album did little for the band in the United States. In 1997, however, it ended up in the hands of Paolo Caru, an influential rock critic in Italy, who became an instant fan.

Sugar Ray originally began their career as a hardcore punk band, before introducing a DJ into the band\'s musical composition, resulting in their first shift in style. This new sound fused hair metal and hardcore punk with funk, sample-based hip-hop, new wave, disco, dub, reggae, R&B and soul music. This sound has been predominately categorized as nu metal and funk metal, as well as alternative metal, hard rock, punk rock and rap metal. Regarding the band\'s early music, singer Mark McGrath stated, "we were the Chili Peppers with zero talent. [...] Out of necessity we kind of became known as a metal band, a little pre nu-metal type rap rock thing before there was rap rock."\n---\nPassage 2: Korn . Korn are identified as the pioneers of nu metal music, a form of alternative metal music which began in the mid-1990s. While generally considered an alternative metal and nu metal band, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, grunge, hard rock, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal, funk, hip-hop, groove, and dissonance. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes.

One critic wrote that Burnt Sugar\'s music "is not the easiest thing to describe", while another critic wrote that "Burnt Sugar sounds like a big cloud".\n---\nPassage 4: Floored . Robert Christgau gave the album a B-, writing, "[Sugar Ray is] the nearest thing to a fresh young rock band the market or the \'underground\' has kicked up this year." The "Los Angeles Times" wrote, "Sugar Ray has a knack for catchy borrowing and for hard-rock crunch colored by pop hooks and a deejay\'s deft scratch effects. The single \'Fly\' is a perfect summer confection that\'s as irresistible as it is lightweight." Allmusic wrote, "Sugar Ray\'s second album, "Floored", is a noticeable improvement from "Lemonade and Brownies". The group\'s fusion of metal, funk, reggae, and rap is seamless and confident, partially because Sugar Ray now emphasize the groove, not the guitars. The group still has difficulty writing a consistent batch of songs, but its hooks are stronger than ever."\n---\nPassage 5: Das Damen .

Cliometrics (), sometimes called new economic history, or econometric history, is the systematic application of economic theory, econometric techniques, and other formal or mathematical methods to the study of history (especially social and economic history). It is a quantitative (as opposed to qualitative or ethnographic) approach to economic history. The term "cliometrics" comes from Clio, who was the muse of history, and was originally coined by the mathematical economist Stanley Reiter in 1960. There has been a revival in \'new economic history\' since the late 1990s. The new economic history originated in 1958 with "The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South" by American economists Alfred H. Conrad and John R. Meyer, which caused a firestorm of controversy with its claim, based on statistical data, that slavery, being economically efficient and highly profitable for slaves owners, would not have ended in the absence of the U.S. Civil War. The new economic history revolution actually began in the mid-1960s and was resisted because many incumbent economic historians were either historians or economists who had very little connection to economic modeling or statistical techniques. Areas of key interest included transportation history, slavery, and agriculture. Cliometrics became better known when Douglass North and William Parker became the editors of the "Journal of Economic History" in 1960. The Cliometrics Meetings began to be held around this time at Purdue University and are still held annually in different locations. Today, cliometric approaches are standard in several journals, including the "Journal of Economic History", "Explorations in Economic History", the "European Review of Economic History", and "Cliometrica".\n---\nPassage 2: Emma Georgina Rothschild . Emma Georgina Rothschild-Sen, CMG (born 16 May 1948) is a British economic historian who is a professor of History at Harvard University. She is also the director of the Joint Centre for History and Economics at Harvard University and an honorary Professor of History and Economics at the University of Cambridge.\n---\nPassage 3: Economic history . In the initial period of the subject\'s development, the LSE position of separating economic history from economics won out. Many universities in the UK developed independent programmes in economic history rooted in the LSE model. Indeed, the Economic History Society had its inauguration at LSE in 1926 and the University of Cambridge eventually established its own economic history programme. However, the past twenty years have witnessed the widespread closure of these separate programmes in the UK and the integration of the discipline into either history or economics departments. Only the LSE and the University of Edinburgh retain a separate economic history department and stand-alone undergraduate and graduate programme in economic history. Cambridge, Glasgow, the LSE and Oxford together train the vast majority of economic historians coming through the British higher education system today.\n---\nPassage 4: Inglorious Empire . Tharoor\'s book has been challenged by a number of historians, Indian and British. In a review published in the Cambridge Review of International Affairs in 2017 the economic historian, Professor Tirthankar Roy, who teaches South Asia and Global History at the London School of Economics and whose recent publications include India in the world economy from antiquity to the present, has described Tharoor\'s grasp of economic history as \'ill-informed\' and his political history \'naive\'. He praised Inglorious Empire as for its \'passion and plain good writing\' while adding that \'none one of these qualities makes the interpretation right, however\'. Roy challeges the central thesis of Tharoor\'s argument in support of the so-called \'Drain theory\': The idea that India was a prosperous society, which British repression made poor, has circulated through academic and political circles since 1900, especially within the Indian National Congress, the political party in which Tharoor belongs. The best part of the book restate this old idea. Structurally, the claim that India was great until British repression made it poor is suspiciously similar to the claim the Hindu nationalists make today - that India was great until Islamic represion from roughly the thirteenth century made it poor. The similarity is not accidental. Both are distinctly political narratives. The Congress [Party] needed the story to fight British rule in the early twentieth century. It was a useful weapon then. But was it ever the correct story? In fact, generations of historians (none cited in the book) have shown that it is not.\n---\nPassage 5: Stephen Broadberry .

Bokor Hill Station (in "Kosthany Phnom Bokor") refers to a collection of French colonial buildings (hotel & casino, church, royal residence etc. ), constructed as a temperate mountain luxury resort and retreat for colonial residents in the early 1920s atop Bokor Mountain in Preah Monivong National Park, about west of Kampot in southern Cambodia. Abandoned for long periods of time, modern infrastructure has made the location easily accessible as re-development is taking place. It was used as the location for the final showdown of the movie "City of Ghosts" (2002) and the 2004 film "R-Point". To the north-east are the Povokvil Waterfalls.\n---\nPassage 3: Bokor Hill Station . The Bokor mountain is abandoned again in 1972, as Khmer Rouge took over the area. During the Vietnamese invasion in 1979, Khmer Rouge entrenched themselves and held on tightly for months. In the early 1990s Bokor Hill was still one of the last strongholds of Khmer Rouge.\n---\nPassage 4: Derek Nguyen . In 2015, Nguyen wrote and directed "The Housemaid" ("Cô Hầu Gái" in Vietnamese), a gothic romance horror film set in 1953 Vietnam during the First Indochina War. It tells the story of an orphaned country girl who falls in love with the French landowner at a haunted rubber plantation. Produced by HKFilm Vietnam, CJ E&M Film Division, and Timothy Linh Bui, the film has been released in 19 territories around the world and is the third-highest-grossing horror movie in Vietnam. It had its North American premiere at the 2017 Los Angeles Film Festival and will be released theatrically in the U.S. in 2018.\n---\nPassage 5: Horror film . While horror is only one genre of film, the influence it presents to the international community is large. Horror movies tend to be a vessel for showing eras of audiences issues across the globe visually and in the most effective manner. Jeanne Hall, a film theorist, agrees with the use of horror films in easing the process of understanding issues by making use of their optical elements. The use of horror films to help audiences understand international prior historical events occurs, for example, to show the horridness of the Vietnam War, the Holocaust and the worldwide AIDS epidemic. However, horror movies do not always present positive endings. In fact, in many occurrences the manipulation of horror presents cultural definitions that are not accurate, yet set an example to which a person relates to that specific cultural from then on in their life.\n\nQUESTION: What horror movie set in 1972 Vietnam was filmed in part in Bokor Hill Station?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>']

Captain Henry Hall was an American from Dennis, Massachusetts who fought in the American Revolutionary War, who later was the first to successfully cultivate cranberries.\n---\nPassage 2: Cranberry . American Revolutionary War veteran Henry Hall first cultivated cranberries in the Cape Cod town of Dennis around 1816. In the 1820s, Hall was shipping cranberries to New York City and Boston from which shipments were also sent to Europe. In 1843, Eli Howes planted his own crop of cranberries on Cape Cod, using the "Howes" variety. In 1847, Cyrus Cahoon planted a crop of "Early Black" variety near Pleasant Lake, Harwich, Massachusetts. In 1860, Edward Watson, a friend of Henry David Thoreau, wrote a poem called "The Cranberry Tart."\n---\nPassage 3: Ethnological Museum, Pristina . Pottery was an early art practice in daily ancient Albanian Illyrian life. Archaeological history findings tell that this production of these goods for practical life service dates back to antiquity and this type of production made of clay lives together with the human being even today, although now only as decorative means. -Productions of pottery amongst ancient Illyrian found their usage in daily life basis. They were made in shapes of dishes for storage of food and drinks. It was a known art in Albanian ethnic area, this type of craftsmanship has been taught in generations, because the baked clay was used for producing a series of objects on preservation and cultivation of foods. The clay was also used of producing at all times dishes of different types, shapes and sizes adequate for the practical needs in service people. These pots were known as pitos, drinks, cereals and other foods were preserved. The small types of dishes served in the daily practice for keeping fluid and except this other types of dishes and objects were produced serving for cult and decoration purposes. From the physiognomy and morphology of production, it must have been a craftsmanship almost professional with exception of producing tools for baking bread, known as çerep. Dishes and furniture from pottery have found their usage extensively in our people, in the village and city as well. This type of craftsmanship had been practiced a lot until around the 1970s. Pottery products now may be encountered only as illustration of passed era and just for curiosity and decoration. Now we may encounter rare masters of pottery, and be counted three or four.\n---\nPassage 4: Cafeteria . A cafeteria in a U.S. military installation is known as a chow hall, a mess hall, a galley, mess decks or, more formally, a dining facility, often abbreviated to DFAC, whereas in common British Armed Forces parlance, it is known as a cookhouse or mess. Students in the USA often refer to cafeterias as lunchrooms, though breakfast as well as lunch is often eaten there. Some school cafeterias in the US and Canada have stages and movable seating that allow use as auditoriums. These rooms are known as cafetoriums. Cafeterias serving university dormitories are sometimes called dining halls or dining commons. A food court is a type of cafeteria found in many shopping malls and airports featuring multiple food vendors or concessions, although a food court could equally be styled as a type of restaurant as well, being more aligned with public, rather than institutionalised, dining. Some institutions, especially schools, have food courts with stations offering different types of food served by the institution itself (self-operation) or a single contract management company, rather than leasing space to numerous businesses. Some monasteries, boarding schools, and older universities refer to their cafeteria as a refectory. Modern-day British cathedrals and abbeys, notably in the Church of England, often use the phrase refectory to describe a cafeteria open to the public. Historically, the refectory was generally only used by monks and priests. For example, although the original 800-year-old refectory at Gloucester Cathedral (the stage setting for dining scenes in the Harry Potter movies) is now mostly used as a choir practice area, the relatively modern 300-year-old extension, now used as a cafeteria by staff and public alike, is today referred to as the refectory.\n---\nPassage 5: Bog body . Amongst the most recent, the corpse of Meenybradden Woman found in Ireland dates to the 16th century and was found in unhallowed ground, with evidence indicating that she may have committed suicide and was therefore buried in the bog rather than in the churchyard because she had committed a Christian sin. She may have also been unable to afford proper burial. Bog bodies have also formed from the corpses of Russian and German soldiers killed fighting on the Eastern Front during the First World War in the Masurian Lake District region of north-eastern Poland.\n---\nPassage 6: Saint-Louis-de-Blandford, Quebec . St-Louis-de-Blandford is known for its high concentration of cranberry bogs; the majority of cranberry cultivation in the province of Quebec happens in and around the town. To take further advantage of this plentiful natural resource and boost the town\'s tourism revenue, an interpretation centre offers educational presentations and visits to local cranberry bogs for groups and interested visitors. Agritourism of this type is common in the Centre-du-Québec region, which is known as the agricultural heartland of Quebec.\n\nQUESTION: Henry Hall is known for fighting in the Revolutionary War, and for being the first to successfully cultivate this food found in what type of bogs?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

Buck called play-by-play for the then-Louisville Redbirds, a minor league affiliate of the Cardinals, and was a reporter for ESPN\'s coverage of the Triple-A All-Star Game. In 1991, he did reporting for St Louis\' CBS affiliate KMOV. Also, in 1991 Buck began broadcasting for the Cardinals on local television and KMOX Radio, filling in while his father was working on CBS telecasts. In the 1992–93 season, he was the play-by-play voice for University of Missouri basketball broadcasts.\n---\nPassage 2: Joe Lintzenich . Lintzenich was the father-in-law of broadcaster Jack Buck and grandfather and namesake to Fox Sports broadcaster Joe Buck.\n---\nPassage 3: St. Louis Cardinals . Former Cardinals broadcasters include Jack Buck, Harry Caray, Dizzy Dean, Joe Garagiola, Sr., and Jay Randolph. Joe Buck, the son of Jack Buck, was an official member of the Cardinals\' broadcast team from 1991 until 2007. The younger Buck is currently the lead play-by-play caller for Fox Sports\' national Major League Baseball and National Football League broadcasts.\n---\nPassage 4: Joe Buck . Buck continued to call Cardinals games after being hired by Fox Sports, initially with his father on KMOX and later on FSN Midwest television. As his network duties increased, however, his local workload shrank, and prior to the 2008 season it was announced that he would no longer be calling Cardinals telecasts for FSN Midwest. This marked the first time since 1960 that a member of the Buck family was not part of the team\'s broadcasting crew.\n---\nPassage 5: Joe Buck . During Fox\'s broadcast of the 2002 World Series, Buck paid implicit tribute to his father, who had died a few months earlier (he had read the eulogy at his father\'s funeral) by calling the final out of Game 6 (which tied the series at 3–3, and thus ensured there would be a Game 7 broadcast the next night) with the phrase, "We\'ll see you tomorrow night." This was the same phrase with which Jack Buck had famously called Kirby Puckett\'s home run off Braves pitcher Charlie Leibrandt which ended Game 6 of the 1991 World Series. Since then, Joe has continued to use this phrase at appropriate times, including Game 4 of the 2004 ALCS, in which the Boston Red Sox famously rallied off New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera in the 9th inning to avoid elimination. When David Ortiz\'s walk-off home run finally won it for the Red Sox in the 12th inning, Buck uttered, "We\'ll see you later tonight," alluding to the fact that the game had extended into the early morning. He also used the phrase at the end of Game 6 of the 2011 World Series when the Cardinals\' David Freese hit a walk-off home run in the 11th inning against the Rangers to send the series to a seventh game (it was actually 20 years and a day since Kirby Puckett\'s home run). The similarity of both the call and the game situation resulted in mentions on national news broadcasts.\n---\nPassage 6: Jack Buck . Buck started broadcasting Cardinals games for KMOX radio in 1954, teaming with Harry Caray, Milo Hamilton (1954), and Joe Garagiola (from 1955). Buck was dropped from the Cardinals booth in 1959 to make room for Buddy Blattner; the following year, he called Saturday "Game of the Week" telecasts for ABC. Buck was re-hired by the Cardinals in 1961 after Blattner departed; Garagiola left the following year, leaving Caray and Buck as the team\'s broadcast voices through 1969.\n\nQUESTION: Which team did Joe Buck\'s father broadcast for?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

Blaine Company moves to a city once known as Murder Town for its high crime rate, but since a re-branding effort has been designated the Golden City. The city is permeated by a strange yellowish haze which may be responsible for some of the murders. Supervisors at the Blaine Company start falling victim to the murder rate until none are left, and a change in management style leads the story\'s narrator to reveal the dark secret at work in the company.\n---\nPassage 4: Chateau Ste. Michelle . Chateau Ste. Michelle is the oldest winery in Washington state. It was founded as the American Wine Company, a 1954 merger of the National Wine Company (NAWICO), founded in 1934, and the Pomerelle Wine Company. (For years, there was a large neon sign advertising NAWICO in Seattle\'s Wallingford neighborhood.) The French-style chateau is located on of land with mature trees that once belonged to lumber baron Frederick Stimson, who used it as a hunting retreat and rural working farm called the Hollywood Farm.\n---\nPassage 5: Château de Beaumesnil .

International Watch Co., also known as IWC, is a luxury Swiss watch manufacturer located in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, and founded by American watchmaker Florentine Ariosto Jones in 1868.\n---\nPassage 2: Gérald Genta . Charles Gérald Genta (1931-2011) was a Swiss jewellery designer, noted for his eponymous line of timepieces as well as his design work with other firms, including IWC, Universal Genève, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet, among others. Christie\'s auction house of New York called Genta\'s work ""the Fabergé of watches"", while "The Wall Street Journal" has called them the "world\'s most complicated and pricey watches".\n---\nPassage 3: International Watch Company . In 1868, an American engineer and watchmaker Florentine Ariosto Jones (1841–1916) who had been a director of E. Howard & Co., in Boston, then America\'s leading watchmaking company, founded the International Watch Company with the intention of combining the craftsmanship of the Swiss with the modern engineering technology from the U.S. to manufacture movements and watch parts for the American market." At the time, wages in Switzerland were relatively low although there was a ready supply of skilled watchmaking labor" mainly carried out by people in their homes. Jones encountered opposition to his plans in French-speaking Switzerland because people feared for their jobs" and the work they did at home because Jones wanted to open a factory.\n---\nPassage 4: Fullpower Technologies . The initial partners were Frederique Constant, the Geneva-based luxury watch manufacturer of classical watches; Alpina, the Swiss Sports Watch manufacturer founded in 1883; and Mondaine, known for its SBB Swiss Railway watches. Together, they are offering ten different models in designer collections for both women and men. Frederique Constant announced in June 2015 that their horological smartwatches were available in stores, and Mondaine started a limited pre-order of their Helvetica 1 Smart watch in July 2015.\n---\nPassage 5: Audemars Piguet . The Royal Oak is considered to be the most popular watch that Audemars Piguet currently manufactures. It was first introduced at the 1972 Baselworld. Designed by Gérald Genta, it is considered to be the first luxury sports watch. The watch was inspired by traditional diving helmets and therefore featured exposed screw heads as well as a unique case design. The watch also featured an integrated bracelet. To mark the 20th anniversary of the Royal Oak, Audemars Piguet hired Emmanuel Gueit to design a new watch known as the Royal Oak Offshore. The Offshore had a much larger case (42mm compared to the original 39mm) and was thought to be tougher than the original. The new watch proved to be just as successful as the original.\n---\nPassage 6: Shinola Detroit . Detroit-based journalist Jon Moy has suggested that the choice of Detroit as the location of Shinola\'s factory was a calculated act of "opportunistic marketing" intended to yield feelings of nostalgia on a purchaser\'s part. He wrote about Shinola: "Shinola is using my city as its shill, pushing a manufactured, outdated and unrealistic ideal of America." On the other hand, many commentators to this article consider this criticism unfair, given that the company has created American manufacturing jobs. Moreover, the company has invested intensely in its employees, flying in watchmakers from Switzerland to train its employees. Additional criticism is noted by Professor Rebekah Modrak in her article "Bougie Crap," for "Infinite Mile Detroit". She writes: In June 2016, the Federal Trade Commission ordered the company to stop using "Where American is Made" as a slogan as "100% of the cost of materials used to make certain watches is attributable to imported materials." Today, some Ronda movements are labeled "Swiss Parts," meaning that most of the parts are made in Switzerland but assembled overseas. Such movements are nickel plated. Ronda movements assembled in Switzerland are gold plated and labeled "Swiss Made." Shinola movements are made of the same parts as the "Swiss Made" movements, but assembled in Detroit; they are gold plated. The dials, hands, cases, crystals, and buckles are manufactured overseas, as are such components of many "Swiss Made" brands, and Shinola claims the cases are made in the same facilities as many luxury "Swiss Made" watch cases are manufactured. The Ronda movements can be purchased by watch repair shops for $23 retail; however, it\'s been pointed out that Swiss Made ETA movements (used in many "Swiss Made" luxury watches) can also be purchased in bulk for around $20. Furthermore, while the standards for labeling a watch "American Made" in the USA is that nearly 100% of the parts must be physically fabricated in America, the legal standard in Switzerland for "Swiss Made" is that no more than 40% of the "value" of the watch can be fabricated overseas. Since the cost of fabricating watch parts overseas that eventually end up in "Swiss Made" watches is much lower than fabricating them in Switzerland, its unclear if the "40% of the value" limitation is particularly meaningful.\n\nQUESTION: Gérald Genta, a Swiss jewelllery designer, worked with what luxury Swiss watch manufacturer which was founded by American Watch,aker Florentine Ariosts Jones?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user's question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

Director Darren Stein brought his script to executives at Columbia Tri-Star, who agreed to finance the film if he could cast either Natalie Portman, Kate Winslet or Rose McGowan. The role of Julie originally went to Rachael Leigh Cook, who was eventually replaced with Rebecca Gayheart because the producers felt she didn\'t have the right chemistry with the two other actresses. Gayheart had auditioned for the roles of Fern and Marcie before she was selected for Julie. Marilyn Manson, who was then dating Rose McGowan, agreed to appear in a non-speaking cameo role.\n---\nPassage 6: Kate Winslet . Winslet\'s third film release of 2001 was the animated film "", based on Charles Dickens\' novel. For the film\'s soundtrack she sang "What If", which proved to be a commercial hit; she donated her earnings from it to children\'s charities. After a year-long absence from the screen, Winslet starred as a headstrong journalist interviewing a professor on death row in the thriller "The Life of David Gale" (2003). She agreed to the project to work with the director Alan Parker, whom she admired, and believed that the film raised pertinent questions about capital punishment. Mick LaSalle thought that the film had muddled the subject and disliked both the film and Winslet\'s performance.\n\nQUESTION: What film was Rebecca Gibney in that also had Kate Winslet in it?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

She shot to stardom for playing the lead role in "Roman Holiday" (1953), for which she was the first actress to win an Academy Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance. That same year, Hepburn won a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Play for her performance in "Ondine". She went on to star in a number of successful films, such as "Sabrina" (1954), "The Nun\'s Story" (1959), "Breakfast at Tiffany\'s" (1961), "Charade" (1963), "My Fair Lady" (1964), and "Wait Until Dark" (1967), for which she received an Academy Award, Golden Globe, and BAFTA nominations. Hepburn won three BAFTA Awards for Best British Actress in a Leading Role. In recognition of her film career, she was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from BAFTA, the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award, the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, and the Special Tony Award. She remains one of only 12 people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards.\n---\nPassage 2: Julius Caesar (1953 film) . "Julius Caesar" won BAFTA awards for Best British Actor (John Gielgud) and Best Foreign Actor (Marlon Brando), and was also nominated for Best Film. It was Brando\'s second of three consecutive BAFTA Best Actor awards, for "Viva Zapata!" (1952), "Julius Caesar" (1953), and "On the Waterfront" (1954).\n---\nPassage 3: Jake Gyllenhaal . In "Brokeback Mountain", Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger play young men who meet as sheep herders and embark upon a sexual relationship that begins in the summer of 1963 and lasts for 20 years. The film was often referred to in the media with the shorthand phrase "the gay cowboy movie", though there was differing opinion on the sexual orientation of the characters. The film won the Golden Lion prize at the Venice Film Festival. The film went on to win four Golden Globe Awards, four British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Awards, and three Academy Awards. Gyllenhaal was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Supporting Actor for his performance but lost to George Clooney for "Syriana". Gyllenhaal also won the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA for the same role and received a Best Supporting Actor nomination and Best Film Ensemble nomination from the Screen Actors Guild. Also for "Brokeback Mountain", he and Ledger won an MTV Movie Award for "Best Kiss" in 2006. Shortly after the 2006 Academy Awards, Gyllenhaal was invited to join the Academy in recognition of his acting career.\n---\nPassage 4: The Jewel in the Crown (TV series) .

The complexities of the plot ensured that no one character was at the centre of the action throughout. All four "Best TV Actress" nominations at that year\'s BAFTAs went to stars of the series, with Ashcroft winning over Wooldridge, James and Parfitt. Pigott-Smith won Best TV Actor.\n---\nPassage 5: Broadchurch . "Broadchurch" series one was nominated for seven BAFTA awards.

The Jingjiang Princes\' Palace (also known as the Jingjiang Princes\' City), commonly known as Wangcheng (Princes\' City), is located in the inner city of Guilin and was built between 1372 and 1392\xa0AD during the Ming dynasty close to the Solitary Beauty Peak (Duxiu Feng). It was originally the official residence of Zhu Shouqian - the great-nephew of Zhu Yuanzhang, the first Ming dynasty emperor). After Zhu Shouqian was declared Prince of Jingjiang by Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, his palace was set at Jingjiang. It took more than 20 years to build the capital, which now has a history of over 630 years and is older than the Forbidden City in Beijing.\n---\nPassage 4: Qinzhou .

The Brighton hotel bombing was a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) assassination attempt against the top tier of the British government that occurred on 12 October 1984 at the Grand Brighton Hotel in Brighton, England. A long-delay time bomb was planted in the hotel by IRA member Patrick Magee, with the purpose of killing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet, who were staying at the hotel for the Conservative Party conference. Although Margaret Thatcher narrowly escaped the blast, five people connected with the Conservative Party were killed, including a sitting Conservative MP, and 31 were injured.\n---\nPassage 2: Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign . Some of the most indiscriminate bombing attacks and killings of the IRA\'s bombing campaign were carried out by the so-called "Balcombe Street Gang", a unit of eight IRA members, who were sent to London in early 1974. They avoided contact with the Irish community there in order to remain inconspicuous and aimed to carry out one attack a week. In addition to bombings, they carried out several assassination attempts. Ross McWhirter, a right wing politician who had offered a £50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the bombers, was shot dead at his home. The group later made an assassination attempt on Edward Heath. They were eventually arrested after a machine-gun attack on an exclusive restaurant on Mayfair. Pursued by police, they took two hostages (a married couple) and barricaded themselves for six days in a flat on Balcombe Street before they surrendered, an incident known as the Balcombe Street Siege. They were sentenced to thirty years each for a total of six murders. At their trial, the group admitted responsibility for the Guildford pub bombing of 5 October 1974, which killed five people (four of whom were off-duty soldiers) and injured 54, as well as the bombing of a pub in Woolwich, which killed another two people and injured 28.\n---\nPassage 3: Provisional Irish Republican Army . The Provisional IRA\'s strategy was to use force to cause the collapse of the government of Northern Ireland and to inflict such casualties on the British forces that the British government would be forced by public opinion to withdraw from Ireland. According to journalist Brendan O\'Brien, "the thinking was that the war would be short and successful. Chief of Staff Seán Mac Stíofáin decided they would \'escalate, escalate and escalate\' until the British agreed to go". This policy involved recruitment of volunteers and carrying out attacks on British forces, as well as mounting a bombing campaign against economic targets. In the early years of the conflict, IRA slogans spoke of, "Victory 1972" and then "Victory 1974". Its inspiration was the success of the "Old IRA" in the Irish War of Independence (1919–1922), which also relied on British public opinion to achieve its aims. In their assessment of the IRA campaign, the British Army would describe the years 1970–72 as the "insurgency phase".\n---\nPassage 4: Irish National Liberation Army . The INLA was founded by former members of the \'Official\' IRA who opposed that group\'s ceasefire. It was initially known as the "People\'s Liberation Army" or "People\'s Republican Army". The INLA waged a paramilitary campaign against the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern Ireland. It was also active to a lesser extent in the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain. High-profile attacks carried out by the INLA include the Droppin Well bombing, the 1994 Shankill Road killings and the assassinations of Airey Neave in 1979 and Billy Wright in 1997. However, it was smaller and less active than the main republican paramilitary group, the Provisional IRA. It was also weakened by feuds and internal tensions. Members of the group used the covernames People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), People\'s Republican Army (PRA) and Catholic Reaction Force (CRF) for attacks its volunteers carried out but the INLA didn\'t want to claim responsibility for.\n---\nPassage 5: Provisional Irish Republican Army . The Provisional IRA emerged in December 1969, following a split in the republican movement. The Troubles had begun a year before, when a largely Catholic, nonviolent civil rights campaign was met with violence from both Ulster loyalists and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC), culminating in the August 1969 riots and deployment of British troops. The IRA initially focused on defence of Catholic areas, but it began an offensive campaign in 1971 (see timeline). The IRA\'s primary goal was to force the United Kingdom to negotiate a withdrawal from Northern Ireland. It used guerrilla tactics against the British Army and RUC in both rural and urban areas. It also carried out a bombing campaign in Northern Ireland and England against what it saw as political and economic targets.\n---\nPassage 6: Dissident Irish Republican campaign . Since the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA or PIRA) called a ceasefire and ended its armed campaign in 1997, breakaway groups opposed to the ceasefire ("dissident Irish republicans") have continued a low-level armed campaign against the security forces in Northern Ireland. The main paramilitaries involved are the Real IRA, Continuity IRA and Óglaigh na hÉireann. They have targeted the Northern Irish police and the British Army in gun and bomb attacks, as well as with mortars and rockets. They have also carried out bombings that are meant to cause disruption. However, their campaign has not been as intensive as the Provisional IRA\'s.\n\nQUESTION: The bomber who carried out a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) assassination attempt against the top tier of the British government in 1984 was born in what year?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

Uncle Wiggily Game is a track board game based on a character in a series of children\'s books by American writer Howard Roger Garis. The game is of the "racing" variety in the style of the European "Goose Game". Players advance along the track from Uncle Wiggily\'s Bungalow to Dr. Possum\'s House. There is no optimal strategy involved as play entirely rests upon a random drawing of the cards. The game was first published by Milton Bradley in 1916 and has seen several editions with minor modifications over the years. "Uncle Wiggily" remains one of the first and favorite games of childhood, and, with "Candy Land", is considered a classic juvenile American board game.\n---\nPassage 2: Uncle Wiggily (board game) . Uncle Wiggily (board game)\n---\nPassage 3: Uncle Wiggily (board game) . The number of spaces on the track, the number of decks of cards, and the number of cards have all fluctuated through the years with the various editions published. The game board has been illustrated several times. The counters have been produced in both painted wood and colored plastic figurines of Uncle Wiggily. The board game in the 50\'s had six painted metal (probably zinc) counters.\n---\nPassage 4: Uncle Wiggily (board game) . The folding center-seamed game board illustrated with characters and scenes from the books is opened and placed upon a flat surface. The two decks of cards are shuffled independently and both placed within reach of the players. Each player selects one of the four counters and places it on Uncle Wiggily\'s Bungalow in the lower left hand corner of the game board. The order of play is determined. The first player draws a card from the yellow deck. He follows the card\'s directions (which are set in lines of rhyming verse) for advancing his counter along the track, or, if instructed, draws a card from the red deck and follows its instruction. In general, the yellow cards either have the player advance a number of spaces or draw a red card, (e.g., "Peetie Bow Wow helps Uncle Wiggily along four hops") which can either direct the player to move a higher number of spaces forward (up to 15) or move up to five spaces backward.\n---\nPassage 5: Uncle Wiggily (board game) . Howard R. Garis created the character "Uncle Wiggily Longears" for a children\'s book in 1910. The game based on the children\'s story was first introduced by the Milton Bradley Company in 1916. Milton Bradley modified the game in 1923, 1949, and 1955. In 1947, the game cost $.67. Parker Brothers obtained the rights to "Uncle Wiggily" in 1967. However, in 1989 both Milton Bradley Company and Parker Brothers reintroduced different versions of the same game. Hasbro now owns both the Parker Brothers and Milton Bradley rights. The game is currently published by Winning Moves.\n---\nPassage 6: Howard R. Garis . By virtue of his accessible characters and engaging plots, Garis was one of the most influential children\'s authors of his day. Many of his books, especially the "Uncle Wiggily" books, are still widely read and are readily available over the internet. Milton Bradley produced an Uncle Wiggily board game in 1967 and again in 1988. The game debuted much earlier though and remained popular until the 1970s.\n---\nPassage 7: Board game . Another important aspect of some games is diplomacy, that is, players making deals with one another. Negotiation generally features only in games with three or more players, cooperative games being the exception. An important facet of "The Settlers of Catan", for example, is convincing players to trade with you rather than with opponents. In "Risk", two or more players may team up against others. "Easy" diplomacy involves convincing other players that someone else is winning and should therefore be teamed up against. "Advanced" diplomacy (e.g., in the aptly named game "Diplomacy") consists of making elaborate plans together, with the possibility of betrayal.\n\nQUESTION: What aspect of the board game Diplomacy is not found in the board game Uncle Wiggily?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user's question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

Jonathan Francesco of New Release Tuesday surmised that "while the song titles for their self-titled debut might not indicate a very original project, the music is actually surprisingly fresh." Francesco noted that "there are numerous musical highpoints on the album that will help it to standout [sic] from the pack. Lyrically, though, it\'s pretty much the standard fare", but the album "more than accomplishes what it set out to accomplish." Lastly, Francesco found that "Citizens manage to find a workable balance between catchy pop music and uplifting praise and worship." Cross Rhythms\' Josh Dipple found that the release "can\'t be faulted for its energy, with songs that long to be played to big crowds at summer festivals, played expertly by a band who have obviously been studiously taking notes, watching the likes of Kings Of Leon and The Strokes."\n---\nPassage 2: ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival . Some place might make you laugh. Some place will make you think. Somewhere you will not find art at all. You will walk through the city with a headset on. You will breath the same air with the artist. Somewhere you perhaps will feel strange pleasure. You will not even dare to enter somewhere. Somewhere you might get shocked. You may discover a slight disorder.\n---\nPassage 3: Savion Glover . When Glover choreographs a piece, he improvises as he generates a dance sequence. As he finds rhythms, he listens for new sounds at many points on the stage. "I\'m feelin\' the stage for sounds. You might find a spot on it that gives you that bass; you might find a spot on the floor that gives you that dead type tom-tom sound." "I think what makes Savion an incredible artist is his extraordinary joy in what he does. He is able to live in that state of joy and not compromise his emotional complexity like the earlier tap dancers had to," says George C. Wolfe.\n---\nPassage 4: Cambridge Folk Festival .

Hisham Matar on his writing process:"I start with very little: the more fragile, the better. The thread has to feel like it is about to snap. Sometimes I begin with a gesture or, in the case of "Naima," a feeling for a character. I had this feeling for Nuri, the protagonist and narrator. It is like that moment when you rush into the concert hall at the last minute. You find your seat as the lights go down. You have not seen the person sitting beside you, but you have a sense of them, of what they might be like, or of how the music is affecting them, the weight of their silence."\n\nQUESTION: At what summer festival might you find music by Bakermat?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

A Master of Science (; abbreviated MS, M.S., MSc, M.Sc., SM, S.M., ScM, or Sc.M.) is a master's degree in the field of science awarded by universities in many countries, or a person holding such a degree. In contrast to the Master of Arts degree, the Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences, engineering, and medicine, and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences. While it ultimately depends upon the specific program, earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a thesis.\n---\nPassage 2: Hari Bahadur Basnet . Hari Bahadur Basnet is a Nepalese politician. He is the head of the Foreign Relations Department of the Rastriya Janashakti Party. Basnet holds a M.Sc. in Engineering.\n---\nPassage 3: Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences . The Department of Informatics offers its own general degree Informatics Track in General Informatics (M.S.,Ph.D.), however doctoral candidates must have a specific research interest. Informatics Track in Interactive and Collaborative Technology (M.S.,Ph.D.) narrows its general degree to the field of human–computer interaction, with end parties as wholly human or man and machine. Software engineering is researched under the Informatics Track in Software (M.S.,Ph.D.) degree, as software development processes are directly related to human interaction and information systems.\n---\nPassage 4: Sunil Bahadur Thapa . In 2012 August he joined Rastriya Janashakti Party as a member and served till April 2013. In May 2013 he elected as member of central working committee of Rastriya Prajatantra Party and also served as coordinator of Foreign Affairs Development.

From April 2014 – October 2015, he served as the minister of commerce and supplies of Government of Nepal.  In March 2017 he was nominated as General Secretary of Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP). Since September 2017 he is serving as the Minister of Industries.\n---\nPassage 5: Chemist . In comparison, chemists who have obtained a Master of Science (M.S.) in chemistry or in a very related discipline may find chemist roles that allow them to enjoy more independence, leadership and responsibility earlier in their careers with less years of experience than those with a bachelor's degree as highest degree. Sometimes, M.S. chemists receive more complex tasks duties in comparison with the roles and positions found by chemists with a bachelor's degree as their highest academic degree and with the same or close-to-same years of job experience. There are positions that are open only to those that at least have a degree related to chemistry at the master's level. Although good chemists without a Ph. D. degree but with relatively many years of experience may be allowed some applied research positions, the general rule is that Ph. D. chemists are preferred for research positions and are typically the preferred choice for the highest administrative positions on big enterprises involved in chemistry-related duties. Some positions, especially research oriented, will only allow those chemists who are Ph. D. holders. Jobs that involve intensive research and actively seek to lead the discovery of completely new chemical compounds under specifically assigned monetary funds and resources or jobs that seek to develop new scientific theories require a Ph. D. more often than not. Chemists with a Ph. D. as the highest academic degree are found typically on the research-and-development department of an enterprise and can also hold university positions as professors. Professors for research universities or for big universities usually have a Ph. D., and some research-oriented institutions might require post-doctoral training. Some smaller colleges (including some smaller four-year colleges or smaller non-research universities for undergraduates) as well as community colleges usually hire chemists with a M.S. as professors too (and rarely, some big universities who need part-time or temporary instructors, or temporary staff), but when the positions are scarce and the applicants are many, they might prefer Ph. D. holders instead.\n---\nPassage 6: Hari Bahadur Basnet . Basnet entered politics in 1970. Three times he was elected to the Rastriya Panchayat. He joined the Rastriya Prajatantra Party when it was formed, and became a Central Committee member of the party.

Speedpass is a keychain RFID device introduced in 1997 by Mobil Oil Corp. (which merged with Exxon to become ExxonMobil in 1999) for electronic payment. It was originally developed by Verifone. As of 2004, more than seven million people possess Speedpass tags, which can be used at approximately 10,000 Exxon, Mobil and Esso gas stations worldwide. At one point, Speedpass was deployed experimentally in fast-food restaurants and supermarkets in select markets. McDonald\'s alone deployed Speedpass in over 400 Chicago area restaurants. The test was deemed a failure and McDonald\'s removed the scanners from all their restaurants in mid-2004. Additionally, the New England grocery chain Stop & Shop tested Speedpass at their Boston area stores; the units were removed in early 2005. Speedpass has also been previously available through a Speedpass Car Tag and a Speedpass-enabled Timex watch.\n---\nPassage 2: Verifone .

On October 13, 2013, U.S. Cellular unveiled its take on Shared Data plans. The plans are comparable to other carriers Shared Data options, but still include all of the same free calling features. A further enhancement to the Shared Data plans was unveiled during Q2 2014, where customers could opt to purchase devices under no-interest "installment agreements" in lieu of a device subsidy. The installment plans are based on the full device cost spread out over 24 equal monthly installment payments, in addition to the cellular service cost. Customers who purchase equipment on installment plans receive discounts on their "connection charges" to their shared data plans, and pay lower activation fees on devices. There is also no penalty for early payoff for devices on installment plans. Customers who purchase devices under installment payments on shared data plans also have an "early upgrade" option to trade-in their devices after 18 payments in order to upgrade to a new device superseded by another installment agreement on the new device. In November, 2015, an enhancement was made to allow customers who purchase devices on installment plans to be able to "pay down" their devices in multiples of the device\'s monthly installment cost at any time. Thus, customers can now either pay off their devices in full at any time or make extra payments towards their devices.

Puma is a genus in the Felidae that contains the cougar (also known as the puma, among other names), and may also include several poorly known Old World fossil representatives (for example, "Puma pardoides", or Owen\'s panther, a large, cougar-like cat of Eurasia\'s Pliocene). In addition to these potential Old World fossils there are a few possible New World fossil representatives such as "Puma pumoides" and the two proposed species of the so-called "American cheetah".\n---\nPassage 2: Vespinae . The subfamily Vespinae contains the largest and best-known eusocial wasps, including true hornets (the genus "Vespa"), and the "yellowjackets" (genera "Dolichovespula" and "Vespula"). The remaining genus, "Provespa", is a small, poorly known group of nocturnal wasps from Southeast Asia. One genus, "Palaeovespa", has been described from the Eocene fossil record, from Colorado. Collectively, the group can be found on all continents except Antarctica, and several of these wasps are invasive species, introduced beyond their native ranges, and can be major pests.\n---\nPassage 3: Trachylepis . Trachylepis is a skink genus in the subfamily Lygosominae found mainly in Africa. Its members were formerly included in the "wastebin taxon" "Mabuya", and for some time in "Euprepis". As defined today, "Trachylepis" contains the clade of Afro-Malagasy mabuyas. The genus also contains a species from the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha, "T. atlantica", and may occur in mainland South America with "Trachylepis tschudii" and "Trachylepis maculata", both poorly known and enigmatic. The ancestors of "T. atlantica" are believed to have rafted across the Atlantic from Africa during the last 9 million years.\n---\nPassage 4: Endogonopsis . Endogonopsis is a poorly known fungal genus, provisionally placed in the Diplocystaceae family. A monotypic genus, it contains the single species Endogonopsis sacramentarium, known from southern Asia. It was originally described by French mycologist Roger Heim in 1966.\n---\nPassage 5: Catnip . Catnip contains the feline attractant nepetalactone. "Nepeta cataria" (and some other species within the genus "Nepeta") are known for their behavioral effects on the cat family, not only on domestic cats but also other species of cats. Several tests showed that leopards, cougars, servals, and lynxes often reacted strongly to catnip in a manner similar to domestic cats and while lions and tigers can react strongly as well, they do not react as consistently.\n---\nPassage 6: Hydnophytum . Hydnophytum is a genus of epiphytic myrmecophytes (ant plants) native to Southeast Asia, the Pacific region and also extending into Queensland in northern Australia. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek "hydnon" "tuber", and "phyton" "plant", after their appearance with their swollen succulent stems. The species grow in tree branches and on trunks. Like the related genus "Myrmecodia", they are known as antplants or ant-house plants. The type species is "Hydnophytum formicarum" from the Philippines. The genus contains 55 species, of which 44 are found in and around the island of New Guinea. Many are poorly known, with 11 known only from the holotype.\n---\nPassage 7: Anthropodyptes . Anthropodyptes is a poorly known monotypic genus of extinct penguin. It contains the single species "Anthropodyptes gilli", known from a Middle Miocene humerus from Australia. The bone is somewhat similar to those found in members of the New Zealand genus "Archaeospheniscus" and thus this genus might, like them, belong to the subfamily Palaeeudyptinae.\n---\nPassage 8: Cricosaurus . The original three skulls (all assigned to different species) were poorly known, and the genus had been considered a junior synonym of "Metriorhynchus", "Geosaurus" or "Dakosaurus" by different palaeontologists in the past. Some phylogenetic analysis did not support the monophyly of "Cricosaurus", However, a more comprehensive analysis in 2009 showed that the species contained in "Cricosaurus" were valid, and furthermore that several long-snouted species formerly classified in the related genera "Geosaurus", "Enaliosuchus" and "Metriorhynchus" were in fact more closely related to the original specimens of "Cricosaurus", and thus were re-classified into this genus.\n\nQUESTION: The genus containing lions also contains several poorly known what?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

Multiverse: Exploring Poul Anderson\'s Worlds\n---\nPassage 3: Multiverse: Exploring Poul Anderson\'s Worlds . Most of the works in the book are short stories, novelettes and novellas set in worlds or other settings created by Anderson, some being sequels to stories by him. Nonfiction reminiscences on Anderson by his wife Karen Anderson and daughter Astrid Anderson Bear and friend and fellow writer Jerry Pournelle are also included. An overall introduction by Bear, individual introductions to each story by both editors, and afterwords to each story by the individual authors provide factual information regarding Anderson, the stories, and the impact he had on the authors\' lives and work.\n---\nPassage 4: Poul Anderson . Poul Anderson was born on November 25, 1926, in Bristol, Pennsylvania, of Scandinavian parents. Shortly after his birth, his father, Anton Anderson, an engineer, moved the family to Texas, where they lived for over ten years. Following Anton Anderson\'s death, his widow took her children to Denmark. The family returned to the United States after the outbreak of World War II, settling eventually on a Minnesota farm. The frame story of his later novel "Three Hearts and Three Lions", before the fantasy part begins, is partly set in the Denmark which the young Anderson personally experienced.\n---\nPassage 5: The Many Worlds of Poul Anderson .

Anderson and Kurland wrote the first book "10 years to Doomsday" and published it with Pyramid Books. Ed Emshwiller illustrated the cover. Kurland and Anderson worked really hard to portray the style of Poul Anderson. After the book was published, Kurland said, “Without even trying - well, that\'s not true, we tried real hard to write a good book - but without even knowing we were doing it, we had achieved the style of one of the heroes whose residence in the van Hala reserved for great writers was already assured.”\n\nQUESTION: what year was the cover artist of Multiverse: Exploring Poul Anderson\'s Worlds born ?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

Ivan Foster (born 1943) is a retired senior minister in the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and a former Democratic Unionist Party politician. He was a lifelong friend and associate of the Democratic Unionist politician and Free Presbyterian Church leader Ian Paisley, but in November 2006 became the most prominent Free Presbyterian to openly challenge Ian Paisley\'s decision to enter into a power-sharing government with Sinn Féin and went on to denounce Ian Paisley from the pulpit of his church in January 2007.\n---\nPassage 2: Ivan Foster . He subsequently became outspoken in the political path taken by Ian Paisley. This began on Thursday 23 November 2006, when Foster gave interviews to the media and met with Ian Paisley in person to express his concerns that the DUP were considering forming a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, under the terms of the St Andrews Agreement. Foster\'s condemnation grew stronger on Sunday 7 January 2007 when, in a sermon lasting 70 minutes, Foster denounced Dr. Paisley because of his apparent willingness to enter into a coalition government with Sinn Féin. In the sermon, (entitled "Where have we gone astray? -- A Question for Free Presbyterians") which was also webcast, Foster said, "We do pray for Dr. Paisley and I never thought I would see the day that I would stand in this pulpit and say I think him wrong entirely and say I could never support what he is doing, but that day has come."\n---\nPassage 3: Ivan Foster . Foster was born into an old County Fermanagh Protestant family which had a strong tradition in the Orange Order. Although he had a Pentecostalist uncle Foster\'s immediate family was not particularly religious and in his youth he had little interest in any sort of Protestantism. Foster found employment with Ulster Television as a trainee film editor and enjoyed a somewhat raucous private life before turning to religion. However once he heard Ian Paisley, whom Foster refers to as "the Big Man", speaking he immediately became a devoted follower of both his religious and political views. Foster promptly entered training for a ministerial life in the Free Presbyterian Church.\n---\nPassage 4: Ian Paisley . On 10 November 1986, a large private rally was held in the Ulster Hall. At the rally, Paisley and DUP members Peter Robinson and Ivan Foster announced the formation of the Ulster Resistance Movement (URM). This was a loyalist paramilitary organization whose purpose was to "take direct action as and when required" to bring down the Agreement and defeat republicanism. Paisley, who stood on the platform in a red beret, said "there are many like myself who\'d like to see the Agreement brought down by democratic means, but wouldn\'t we all be fools if we weren\'t prepared". Other recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and the movement was organized into nine \'battalions\'. The following year, the URM helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland, which were shared out between the URM, UVF and UDA. Most, but not all, of the weaponry was seized by police in 1988. In 1989, URM members attempted to trade Shorts\' missile blueprints for weapons from the apartheid South African regime. Following these revelations, the DUP said that it had cut its links with the URM in 1987.\n---\nPassage 5: Ulster Resistance . The group was launched at a three thousand-strong invitation-only meeting at the Ulster Hall. The rally was chaired by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Press Officer Sammy Wilson and addressed by party colleagues Ian Paisley, Peter Robinson and Ivan Foster. Also on the platform was Alan Wright, the chairman of the Ulster Clubs. The launch rally was followed by a number of similar assemblies across Northern Ireland. Its aim were to “take direct action as and when required” to end the Anglo-Irish Agreement.\n---\nPassage 6: Ivan Foster . Foster first became active in politics in 1964 when, along with fellow student minister William Beattie he campaigned in support of Ulster Protestant Action members seeking election to Belfast Corporation. He became a close associate of Paisley, who at the time utilised provocative street demonstrations targeting both Catholic areas and mainstream Protestant denominations, and was arrested and briefly held in Crumlin Road gaol in 1966 for public order offences.\n---\nPassage 7: Ivan Foster . Subsequently, Foster abandoned political life to concentrate on his work as a Free Presbyterian minister, having decided that the policies of the DUP were becoming too liberal. He formally announced his resignation from the party in 1989, adding particular criticism of the close relationship between Paisley and Ulster Unionist Party leader Jim Molyneaux, which Foster felt was compromising DUP independence.\n---\nPassage 8: Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster . The appointment of Paisley as First Minister of Northern Ireland in May 2007 led to a great deal of controversy within the Free Presbyterian Church. Many members of the church claimed that such an appointment put Paisley, as Moderator, at odds with many of the core beliefs of his church. The church had declared some years previously that it would be unbiblical to have terrorists or ex-terrorists in the government of Northern Ireland. The church is also strongly opposed to homosexuality, yet the First Minister\'s office is responsible for protecting LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. One of Paisley\'s strongest critics was his erstwhile ally and former prison cellmate Ivan Foster. A stormy meeting of the Presbytery of the church in September 2007 resolved the crisis by agreeing that Paisley would step down as Moderator in January 2008. The Presbytery met in Dungannon on 18 January 2008 to elect a new Moderator and selected Ron Johnstone, who had been Deputy Moderator. Paisley was therefore replaced as Moderator after more than 50 years in the post.\n\nQUESTION: Who is older, Ivan Foster or Ian Paisley?\n\nPlease provide a concise answer based ONLY on the CONTEXT.\n<|eot_id|>\n\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>', '<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\nYou are a helpful and accurate question-answering assistant. \nUse ONLY the provided Wikipedia passages below to answer the user\'s question concisely. \nDo not use any external knowledge.

When Lewis was four years old, her mother married businessman Tom Lewis, and Judy went by his last name. However, Tom never adopted Judy because he never knew that she was Loretta\'s biological daughter, a fact that he would have learned had he gone through adoption procedures. Christopher Lewis once told Judy that at one time his father thought that Judy was the biological daughter of Loretta\'s sister, Sally Blane, because of Judy\'s resemblance to Sally. Her mother went on to have two sons, Christopher Lewis and Peter Lewis, with Tom Lewis.\n---\nPassage 2: Judy Lewis . Lewis bore a striking resembance to Gable as she grew older, including having ears that stuck out like his ears. Young often put bonnets on the toddler, and had Lewis undergo a painful operation on her ears as a child to pin them back in another attempt to hide her real parentage. As Lewis grew up, several people in Hollywood, as well as the public, began to believe that Clark Gable was her biological father. When Judy was fifteen, Gable came to her mother\'s house to visit her briefly. Gable asked Lewis about her life and then upon leaving, kissed her on her forehead. It was the only time that Judy ever spoke to Gable, and she had no idea he was her father. When Lewis met her future husband at the age of twenty-three, it was he who told her that Gable was her biological father and that "everyone" knew, which stunned Lewis. Lewis, at age 31, finally confronted her mother when Gable had been dead for five years. Loretta Young became nauseated but confirmed the truth. Lewis wrote a book about her life titled "Uncommon Knowledge", because it seemed that she was the only one who did not know about her true parentage. Loretta Young died on August 12, 2000, at age 87; her autobiography, published posthumously, confirmed that Gable was indeed Lewis\'s father. Loretta Young reportedly told her daughter-in-law in 1998 that she was date raped by Clark Gable, which was how her daughter was conceived. The family stayed silent about the claim until Loretta Young and her daughter Judy Lewis were both deceased.\n---\nPassage 3: Clark Gable . Judy Lewis was Gable\'s only child born while he was alive. Nineteen months after the birth, Young claimed to have adopted Judy. The girl grew up resembling Gable very much, including having large ears that stuck out. She went by the name Judy Lewis after her mother married Tom Lewis when Judy was four years old. According to Lewis, Gable visited her home once, when she was 15, asked about her life, and kissed her on her forehead upon leaving. He did not tell her that he was her biological father. Neither Gable nor Young would ever publicly acknowledge the truth about their daughter, but most in Hollywood and some in the general public believed Gable was her father, due, in part, to their strong resemblance and the timing of her birth.\n---\nPassage 4: Judy Moran . Judith Maryanne Brooks was born in Victoria on 18 December 1944. In 1963, she married Leslie John "Johnny" Cole, who was shot dead in Sydney drug-related gangland conflict in 1982. Cole was the father of their son Mark Cole, born in 1964 (later Mark Moran). Judy began a relationship with Lewis Moran in 1966 and was divorced from Cole at the time of his death. Judy and Lewis Moran had a son Jason Moran in 1967. The Morans separated in 1995.\n---\nPassage 5: Loretta Young . Judy Lewis wrote in her autobiography, "Uncommon Knowledge", that some people made fun of her because of the prominent ears she had inherited from her father. She states that at seven, she had an operation to pin back her large ears and that her mother always had her wear bonnets as a child. In 1958, Lewis\'s future husband, Joseph Tinney, told her "everybody" knew that Gable was her biological father. The only time she remembered Gable visiting her was once, at her home when she was a teenager; she had no idea he was her biological father. Several years later, he appeared on "The Loretta Young Show" after Young had been hospitalized for several months. Lewis was an assistant and was right behind her mother when she noticed Gable. They never had a relationship, and she never saw him again. Several years later, after becoming a mother herself, Lewis finally confronted her mother, who privately admitted the truth, stating that Judy was "a walking mortal sin."\n---\nPassage 6: Son Lewis . Son Lewis (born Andrew Lewis, December 11, 1951, Paterson, New Jersey) is an American blues singer and guitarist. He was nicknamed "Son" or "Sonny" by his family, to differentiate him from his father, Andrew Lewis Sr.\n---\nPassage 7: Howard Jackson (kickboxer) . In 1974, The California Flash, as Jackson was nicknamed, was invited to participate in the first PKA world Full-contact championship promoted by Mike Anderson and Don and Judy Quine. It was celebrated in The Los Angeles Arena on September 14. Jackson was one of four elite American fighters invited to the event, along with Jeff Smith, Bill Wallace, and Joe Lewis.\n---\nPassage 8: LunchMoney Lewis . Lewis was born in Miami, Florida on January 11, 1988. His father, Ian Lewis, and uncle, Roger Lewis, are both members of the Jamaican reggae group Inner Circle and have a recording studio, Circle House, in which artists including Flo Rida and Lil Wayne have recorded.
