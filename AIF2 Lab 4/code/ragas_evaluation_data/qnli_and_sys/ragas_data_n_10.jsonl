Immature B cells, which have never been exposed to an antigen, express only the IgM isotype in a cell surface bound form. The B lymphocyte, in this ready-to-respond form, is known as a \"naive B lymphocyte.\" The naive B lymphocyte expresses both surface IgM and IgD. The co-expression of both of these immunoglobulin isotypes renders the B cell ready to respond to antigen. B cell activation follows engagement of the cell-bound antibody molecule with an antigen, causing the cell to divide and differentiate into an antibody-producing cell called a plasma cell. In this activated form, the B cell starts to produce antibody in a secreted form rather than a membrane-bound form. Some daughter cells of the activated B cells undergo isotype switching, a mechanism that causes the production of antibodies to change from IgM or IgD to the other antibody isotypes, IgE, IgA, or IgG, that have defined roles in the immune system.", "Retinoblastoma protein .

At the same time, during S phase all cells must duplicate their DNA very precisely, a process termed DNA replication.

The structure formed by the centrosomes and the microtubules is named mitotic spindle, due to its characteristic shape, holding the chromosomes between the two centrosomes. Both sister chromatids stay together until anaphase; at this moment they separate from each other and they travel towards the centrosome to which they are attached. In this way, when the two daughter cells separate at the end of the division process, each one will receive a complete set of chromatids.

As the cinematic universe moves forward, you may start to see the cinematic universe adopt that same pattern, as the publishing has, where there's closure with some characters and new beginnings with other characters.\" He added that, for directors to \"fit\" in at Marvel, they must understand how to \"take a larger story and wrangle it into a moment\", yet keep it connected. On allowing directors and writers to work within Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has \"big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but the way that you get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit.\" For the Russos in \"The Winter Soldier\", they had to deal with the idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. being infiltrated by Hydra, with Joe saying, \"how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film.\" Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team \"come up with conceptually what we want to do\" for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film?

Later expanding on this process, Feige explained that before talking to any directors on a film, Marvel Studios often puts together a \"lookbook\" of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for the film.

Bent developed a serious problem with alcohol during this period. He became prosperous by assisting European-American cattlemen to obtain grazing leases on Indian land. Because of his influence peddling, he lost the trust of some Cheyenne and was fired as a U.S. interpreter.

Presented as a way for Indians to assimilate by adopting Euro-American farming styles, the allotment plan caused the loss of considerable tribal land. The former communal tribal land was allocated to households of members, and any remaining land was declared \"surplus\" by the government, making it available for sale to non-Indian parties.

One context in which the existence of further facts is debated is that of personal identity across time: in what sense is Alice today really the \"same\" person as Alice yesterday, given that across the two days the state of her brain is different and the atoms that constitute her are different? One may believe that at bottom, there is nothing more than the atoms and their arrangement at different points in time; while we may for practical purposes come up with some notion of sameness of a person, this notion does not reflect anything deeper about reality. Under this view there would be no further facts. Alternatively, one may believe that there is a deeper sense in which Alice yesterday and Alice today really are the same person. For example, if one believes in Cartesian souls, one may believe that Alice yesterday and Alice today are the same person if and only if they correspond to the same soul. Or one may not believe in Cartesian souls, but yet believe that whether Alice yesterday and Alice today are the same person is a question about something other than facts about which atoms constitute them and how they are arranged. These would both be further-fact views. The debate about further facts about personal identity over time is most closely associated with Derek Parfit. In his \"Reasons and Persons\", he describes the non-reductionist's view that \"personal identity is a deep further fact, distinct from physical and psychological continuity\". Parfit takes a reductionist stance and argues against this further-fact view. As a result it is not clear whether a person has any reason to be worried about her future self in a special way that does not also apply to worrying about others, with Parfit arguing that it is plausible that \"only the deep further fact gives me a reason to be specially concerned about my future\" (his so-called \"Extreme Claim\"). Sydney Shoemaker objects that it is not clear how a further fact would give a reason for such special concerns, either. Harold Langsam has attempted to give a positive account of how a further fact would give such a reason. David Chalmers lists a number of other types of candidates for further facts. One is facts about conscious experience. For example, it is difficult to see how it follows from the physical facts what it is like to experience seeing red; indeed, inverted spectrum scenarios, where we imagine that experiences of colors are swapped without anything else changing, might suggest that things could have been different without the physical facts changing. Another candidate for a further fact is the fact that there is any conscious experience at all, rather than everyone being a philosophical zombie. Christopher Hill and Brian Mclaughlin have argued against the idea that facts about consciousness are further facts, disputing the logical possibility of a world physically identical to ours in which the facts about consciousness are different.", "Carl Wieland .

Other composers with whom he worked included Simon Mayr, a composer and Donizetti's teacher, as well as the prolific Giovanni Pacini.", "Gaetano Donizetti . A coincidental meeting around April 1818 with an old school friend, Bartolomeo Merelli (who was to go on to a distinguished career), led to an offer to compose the music from a libretto which became \"Enrico di Borgogna\". Without a commission from any opera house, Donizetti decided to write the music first and then try to find a company to accept it. He was able to do so when , the impresario of the Teatro San Luca (an early theatre built in 1629, which later became the Teatro Goldoni) in Venice accepted it. Thus \"Enrico\" was presented on 14 November 1818, but with little success, the audience appearing to be more interested in the newly re-decorated opera house rather than the performances, which suffered from the last-minute withdrawal of the soprano Adelaide Catalani due to stage fright and the consequent omission of some her music. Musicologist and Donizetti scholar William Ashbrook provides a quotation from a review in the \"Nuovo osservatore veneziano\" of 17 November in which the reviewer notes some of these performance issues which faced the composer, but he adds: \"one cannot but recognize a regular handling and expressive quality in his style.

It is unclear as to how this connection came about: whether it had been at Merelli's suggestion or whether, as William Ashbrook speculates, it had been Mayr who had initially been approached by Paterni to write the opera but who, due to advancing age, had recommended his prize pupil. This new \"opera seria\" became Donizetti's \"Zoraida di Granata\", his ninth work.

The opera has been characterised as both an homage to Russian writers, and a satire of bourgeois manners and the \"Romeo and Juliet\" subgenre of romance.

Simultaneously, the genres of light music, operetta, musical comedy, and later, rock opera, were developed by such composers as Isaak Dunayevsky, Dmitri Kabalevsky, Dmitri Shostakovich (Opus 105: \"Moscow, Cheryomushki\", operetta in 3 acts, (1958)), Tikhon Khrennikov, and later by Gennady Gladkov, Alexey Rybnikov, and Alexander Zhurbin.", "Nicola D'Arienzo .

Eight more operas followed between 1866 and 1887, all but one in the \"opera buffa\" or \"semiseria\" genres, and most of them with libretti written in Neapolitan dialect. Of these, his greatest critical success was \"Il cuoco e il segretario\" (The Cook and the Secretary) which premiered at the Teatro Rossini in Naples in January 1873. The critic from \"Gazzetta musicale di Milano\" praised the opera for its \"good taste, dramatic force, original melodies, and brilliant orchestration\". After 1880 D'Arienzo devoted his compositional activity primarily to instrumental and sacred music but composed one final opera, \"La fiera\" which premiered at the Teatro Nuovo 1887 to great success.

Later in the century his last opera, \"The Rake's Progress\" (1951), also marks the end of the neoclassical phase of his compositions. Other operas of this period by composers identified as neoclassicists include Paul Hindemith's \"Mathis der Maler\" (1938), Sergei Prokofiev's \"Voina y Mir\" (War and Peace, 1941\u20131943), Bohuslav Martinu's \"Julietta aneb sn\u00e1r\" (1937) and Francis Poulenc's \"Les mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias\" (1945).", "Modest Mussorgsky .

In 1868/1869 he composed the opera \"Boris Godunov\", about the life of the Russian tsar, but it was rejected by the Mariinsky Opera. Mussorgsky thus edited the work, making a final version in 1874. The early version is considered darker and more concise than the later version, but also more crude. Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov re-orchestrated the opera in 1896 and revised it in 1908.

Tonina (whose character is a parody of opera buffa) enters and demands a role in the new opera. The composer and the librettist quickly concoct a vocal number for her. A quarrel then erupts between Eleonora and Tonina over which of them should sing the opera's opening aria. The scene culminates in having both sing their arias simultaneously.

During five years, Heisman compiled a 12\u20134\u20132 record, before departing for Clemson in 1900. Auburn's very first conference membership came in 1895, when it joined the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA).

Vanderbilt still won however, 9 to 6; the first time in the history of southern football that a field goal decided a game. Auburn suffered its only loss to Pop Warner's champion Bulldogs in 1896. The 1897 team finished $700 in debt, and Heisman was the actor, director, and producer of David Garrick to raise the money. As such, he is founder of Auburn's first theatrical group: The A.P.I. Dramatic Club. The 1898 team went 2\u20131 with its only loss to SIAA champion North Carolina. In Heisman's opinion, the 1899 team was his best while at Auburn.

Ivan Foster (born 1943) is a retired senior minister in the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster and a former Democratic Unionist Party politician. He was a lifelong friend and associate of the Democratic Unionist politician and Free Presbyterian Church leader Ian Paisley, but in November 2006 became the most prominent Free Presbyterian to openly challenge Ian Paisley's decision to enter into a power-sharing government with Sinn F\u00e9in and went on to denounce Ian Paisley from the pulpit of his church in January 2007.", "Ulster Resistance .

Foster found employment with Ulster Television as a trainee film editor and enjoyed a somewhat raucous private life before turning to religion. However once he heard Ian Paisley, whom Foster refers to as \"the Big Man\", speaking he immediately became a devoted follower of both his religious and political views. Foster promptly entered training for a ministerial life in the Free Presbyterian Church.", "Ivan Foster . Foster first became active in politics in 1964 when, along with fellow student minister William Beattie he campaigned in support of Ulster Protestant Action members seeking election to Belfast Corporation.

On 10 November 1986, a large private rally was held in the Ulster Hall. At the rally, Paisley and DUP members Peter Robinson and Ivan Foster announced the formation of the Ulster Resistance Movement (URM). This was a loyalist paramilitary organization whose purpose was to \"take direct action as and when required\" to bring down the Agreement and defeat republicanism. Paisley, who stood on the platform in a red beret, said \"there are many like myself who'd like to see the Agreement brought down by democratic means, but wouldn't we all be fools if we weren't prepared\". Other recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and the movement was organized into nine 'battalions'. The following year, the URM helped smuggle a large shipment of weapons into Northern Ireland, which were shared out between the URM, UVF and UDA. Most, but not all, of the weaponry was seized by police in 1988. In 1989, URM members attempted to trade Shorts' missile blueprints for weapons from the apartheid South African regime. Following these revelations, the DUP said that it had cut its links with the URM in 1987.", "Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster . The appointment of Paisley as First Minister of Northern Ireland in May 2007 led to a great deal of controversy within the Free Presbyterian Church. Many members of the church claimed that such an appointment put Paisley, as Moderator, at odds with many of the core beliefs of his church. The church had declared some years previously that it would be unbiblical to have terrorists or ex-terrorists in the government of Northern Ireland. The church is also strongly opposed to homosexuality, yet the First Minister's office is responsible for protecting LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. One of Paisley's strongest critics was his erstwhile ally and former prison cellmate Ivan Foster. A stormy meeting of the Presbytery of the church in September 2007 resolved the crisis by agreeing that Paisley would step down as Moderator in January 2008. The Presbytery met in Dungannon on 18 January 2008 to elect a new Moderator and selected Ron Johnstone, who had been Deputy Moderator. Paisley was therefore replaced as Moderator after more than 50 years in the post.", "Ivan Foster . Subsequently, Foster abandoned political life to concentrate on his work as a Free Presbyterian minister, having decided that the policies of the DUP were becoming too liberal.

This began on Thursday 23 November 2006, when Foster gave interviews to the media and met with Ian Paisley in person to express his concerns that the DUP were considering forming a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, under the terms of the St Andrews Agreement. Foster's condemnation grew stronger on Sunday 7 January 2007 when, in a sermon lasting 70 minutes, Foster denounced Dr. Paisley because of his apparent willingness to enter into a coalition government with Sinn F\u00e9in. In the sermon, (entitled \"Where have we gone astray? -- A Question for Free Presbyterians\") which was also webcast, Foster said, \"We do pray for Dr. Paisley and I never thought I would see the day that I would stand in this pulpit and say I think him wrong entirely and say I could never support what he is doing, but that day has come.\"", "Ian Paisley Jr .

Though a direct sequel to \"Final Fantasy X\", \"Final Fantasy X-2\" does not duplicate its predecessor's gameplay; instead, it innovates on traditional elements. Like pre-\"Final Fantasy X\" installments, characters \"level up\" after a certain number of battles, by gaining pre-determined stat bonuses. The conditional turn-based battle system in \"Final Fantasy X\" has been replaced by a faster-paced variation of the \"Final Fantasy\" series' traditional active time battle (ATB) system, which was originally designed by Hiroyuki Ito and first featured in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Whenever a random enemy is encountered, the ATB system is used. Under this enhanced version of the ATB, playable characters may interrupt an enemy while they are preparing to take action, instead of waiting for an enemy's turn to finish before attacking. Furthermore, it is possible for both characters and enemies to chain attacks together for greater damage.", "1990s in video gaming . It was in the early 1990s that the console role-playing video game genre distinguished itself greatly from computer RPGs, with the \"Final Fantasy\" series playing an instrumental role. \"Final Fantasy III\" introduced the \"job system\", a character progression engine allowing the player to change a character's class, as well as acquire new and advanced classes. \"Final Fantasy IV\" (1991) was one of the first role-playing games to feature a complex, involving plot, placing a much greater emphasis on character development and pioneering \"the whole concept of dramatic storytelling in an RPG.\" It also introduced a new battle system: the \"Active Time Battle\" system, developed by Hiroyuki Ito, where the time-keeping system does not stop. Square Co., Ltd. filed a United States patent application for the ATB system on March 16, 1992, under the title \"Video game apparatus, method and device for controlling same\" and was awarded the patent on February 21, 1995. On the battle screen, each character has an ATB meter that gradually fills, and the player is allowed to issue a command to that character once the meter is full. The fact that enemies can attack or be attacked at any time is credited with injecting urgency and excitement into the combat system. Both the \"job system\" and the ATB system were fully developed in \"Final Fantasy V\" (1992) and continued to be used in later \"Final Fantasy\" games as well as other Square games such as \"Chrono Trigger\" (1995). \"Final Fantasy VI\" (1994) and the \"Megami Tensei\" series were some of the first RPGs to move away from the typical medieval setting, with \"Final Fantasy VI\" instead being set in a steampunk environment and the \"Megami Tensei\" games set in modern-day Japan.", "Final Fantasy VIII . Like the \"Final Fantasy\" games before it, \"Final Fantasy VIII\" consists of three main modes of play: the world map, the field map, and the battle screen. The world map is a 3D display in which the player may navigate freely across a small-scale rendering of the game world. Characters travel across the world map in a variety of ways, including by foot, car, Chocobo, train, and airship. The field map consists of controllable 3D characters overlaid on one or more 2D pre-rendered backgrounds, which represent environmental locations such as towns or forests. The battle screen is a 3D model of a location such as a street or room, where turn-based fights between playable characters and CPU-controlled enemies take place. The interface is menu-driven, as in previous titles, but with the typical weapon and armor systems removed and new features present, such as the Junction system. Also featured is a collectible card-based minigame called \"Triple Triad\". For \"Final Fantasy VIII\", Hiroyuki Ito designed a battle system based on summoned monsters, called \"Guardian Forces\", abbreviated in-game as \"GF\". Assigning (\"junctioning\") a GF onto a character allows the player to use battle commands beyond \"Attack\" with the main weapon, such as Magic, GF (to have a junctioned GF perform an action), and Item. Previous \"Final Fantasy\" titles provided each character with a limited pool of magic points that were consumed by each spell; in \"Final Fantasy VIII\", spells are acquired (\"drawn\") either from enemies in battle, Draw Points distributed throughout the environments, or by refining items and cards. Spells are then stocked on characters as quantified inventory (up to 100 per spell and limited to 32 distinct spells per character) and are consumed one by one when used. Characters can also junction (equip) these spells onto their statistics\u2014such as Strength, Vitality, and Luck\u2014for various bonuses, provided the character has junctioned a Guardian Force. The junction system's flexibility affords the player a wide range of customization.", "Final Fantasy XII . Excluding the massively multiplayer online role-playing game \"Final Fantasy XI\", \"Final Fantasy XII\" is the first entry in the main \"Final Fantasy\" series not to include random encounters. Instead, enemies are visible in the overworld and the player may choose to fight or avoid them. Battles unfold in real time using the \"Active Dimension Battle\" (ADB) system. Battles begin when the party comes within range of an aggressive enemy, the party attacks an enemy, or a story event initiates a confrontation. When a character or enemy begins an action, target lines connect characters to other party members or enemies; different colors represent the different types of action. The player may swap to and issue commands to any of the three characters in the party, but guest characters are controlled by artificial intelligence (AI). Battle commands are initiated through a series of menus, and include Attack, Magicks, Technicks, Mist, Gambits, and Items. The player may switch any active character with an inactive character at any time, unless the active character is targeted by an attack or ability. Characters who are knocked out may also be substituted.", "Recurring elements in the Final Fantasy series . The battle system most closely associated with \"Final Fantasy\" is the \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system: while utilizing a turn-based combat system, action meters are assigned to all characters that are emptied when they act in battle. Each player character being issued a command when their action meter is filled: enemies could attack at any time despite player actions being in progress, adding an element of urgency to battles. The ATB system was designed by Hiroyuki Ito. According to Kawazu, Ito was inspired while he was watching a Formula One race and seeing racers pass each other at different speeds. This gave him the idea of different speed values for the individual characters. Ito himself described the inspiration as his wish to balance pure turn-based mechanics with real-time battle mechanics, which played into a movement in Formula One where cars were shifting towards using semi-automatic gearboxes. For \"Final Fantasy V\", Ito evolved the system further as he felt the version in \"Final Fantasy IV\" was incomplete. A mechanic introduced in \"Final Fantasy VII\" was Limit Breaks, special cinematic moves that have become a staple of the series. The ATB system was in use until \"Final Fantasy X\", which switched to a system called the \"Conditional Turn-based Battle\" system: while reverting to a purely turn-based model, it included additional elements such as in-battle party member switching. \"Final Fantasy XI\", \"Final Fantasy XIV\" and its sequel \"A Realm Reborn\" used real-time command-based combat systems and removed random encounters, playing in a similar fashion to other contemporary MMORPGs. \"Final Fantasy XII\" used a similar real-time command-based system to \"Final Fantasy XI\": dubbed the \"Active Dimension Battle\" system, characters fought enemies in environments without random encounters, with players acting on commands inputted by the player.", "History of Eastern role-playing video games . In 1991, \"Final Fantasy Adventure\", the first in the \"Mana\" series, featured the ability to kill townspeople. The most important RPG that year, however, was \"Final Fantasy IV\", one of the first role-playing games to feature a complex, involving plot, placing a much greater emphasis on character development, personal relationships, and dramatic storytelling. It also introduced a new battle system: the \"Active Time Battle\" system, developed by Hiroyuki Ito, where the time-keeping system does not stop. On the battle screen, each character has an ATB meter that gradually fills, and the player is allowed to issue a command to that character once the meter is full. The fact that enemies can attack or be attacked at any time is credited with injecting urgency and excitement into the combat system. The ATB combat system was considered revolutionary for being a hybrid between turn-based and real-time combat, with its requirement of faster reactions from players appealing to those who were more used to action games. That same year, 's \"Metal Max\" was an early non-linear, open-ended, post-apocalyptic, vehicle combat RPG that lacked a predetermined story path and instead allowed the player to choose which missions to follow in whatever order while being able to visit any place in the game world. The ending also can be determined by the player's actions, while they can continue playing the game even after the ending. The game also allowed the player to choose the character classes for each player character as well as create and modify the tanks used in battle. The \"Metal Max\" series continued to allow tank customization and open-ended gameplay, while also allowing the player to obtain an ending at almost any time, particularly \"Metal Saga\", which could be completed with an ending scenario just minutes into the game, making it the shortest possible RPG. Telenet Japan released a console remake of its 1988 action-platform RPG \"Exile\", which was controversial, with a plot revolving around a time-traveling Crusades-era Syrian Islamic Assassin who assassinates various religious/historical figures as well as modern-day political leaders, with similarities to the present-day \"Assassin's Creed\" action game series, while the gameplay of \"Exile\" involved taking drugs that increase or decrease statistics and affect the player's heart-rate, displayed using a heart monitor.", "Final Fantasy XIII . As in \"Final Fantasy XII\", enemies are integrated into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen similar to those used in previous \"Final Fantasy\" titles. A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots. The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.", "Star Ocean (video game) . When players move their party in the game's dungeons and paths, random battles occur. Combat is done in a 3D isometric point of view. Unlike games in the \"Final Fantasy\" or \"Dragon Quest\" series, the battles are not turn based, but play out in real time. Players also do not directly control all of their characters actions, but instead chose battle strategies beforehand for all but one of their characters who then move and attack their closest enemy automatically. Added to \"First Departure\" was a combo attack system where special attacks stack to become more powerful. Players can equip characters with four special abilities with \"ranged\" and \"distance\" slots, whereas the remake reduced that number to two. Up to four characters can participate in battles, but the player is only able to control one character at a time, leaving the others to be controlled by the computer's artificial intelligence. The player can switch which character is being controlled in battle. All characters have a standard \"attack\" option, in which the character's equipped item is used to attack whichever enemy the player has locked on to. Additionally, special techniques called Symbology can be used as well, which have the potential to deal more damage, but cost MP (Mental Points), of which each character has a finite amount. Special attacks are assigned before combat begins.", "Final Fantasy . In \"Final Fantasy\" games, players command a party of characters as they progress through the game's story by exploring the game world and defeating opponents. Enemies are typically encountered randomly through exploring, a trend which changed in \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\" and \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\". The player issues combat orders\u2014like \"Fight\", \"Magic\", and \"Item\"\u2014to individual characters via a menu-driven interface while engaging in battles. Throughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. Prior to \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\", battles were turn-based with the protagonists and antagonists on different sides of the battlefield. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0IV\" introduced the \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system that augmented the turn-based nature with a perpetual time-keeping system. Designed by Hiroyuki Ito, it injected urgency and excitement into combat by requiring the player to act before an enemy attacks, and was used until \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\", which implemented the \"Conditional Turn-Based\" (CTB) system. This new system returned to the previous turn-based system, but added nuances to offer players more challenge. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\" adopted a real-time battle system where characters continuously act depending on the issued command. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\" continued this gameplay with the \"Active Dimension Battle\" system. \"Final Fantasy XIII\"s combat system, designed by the same man who worked on \"X\", was meant to have an action-oriented feel, emulating the cinematic battles in \"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\". The latest installment to the franchise, Final Fantasy XV, introduces a new \"Open Combat\" system. Unlike previous battle systems in the franchise, the \"Open Combat\" system (OCS) allows players to take on a fully active battle scenario, allowing for free range attacks and movement, giving a much more fluid feel of combat. This system also incorporates a \"Tactical\" Option during battle, which pauses active battle to allow use of items.", "Hiroyuki Ito . As the game designer of a \"Final Fantasy\" game, Ito tries to balance the story and event scenes with the gameplay. When he begins his work on a title, he does not consider the story at hand but rather adapts his game system to it as closely as possible over the time. He thinks that it is his job to smoothly implement a game so the people in charge of the stories do not have to worry about this aspect. He also believes that the most important factor of the \"Final Fantasy\" series is the player's feeling of accomplishment after beating the game and seeing \"The End\" on the screen. Professional sports were the primary inspiration behind Ito's battle systems. The monsters in \"Final Fantasy IV\" and the Gambit system in \"Final Fantasy XII\" resemble aspects of the NFL in that their actions are based on the most likely outcome of a specific situation. The Active Time Battle system was similarly inspired by Formula One, as Ito had the idea to give characters different speed values after seeing a race in which the cars passed each other.

Kim Go-eun was a drama major at Korea National University of Arts who had never appeared in a film or TV series before, not even in a minor role, having only previously acted in student productions or school plays. She met Jung in 2011 through a circle of friends and was not even aware that auditions for the film were being held. \"I ended up having an audition after chatting with the director. There wasn't even any time for me to prepare,\" Kim recalled. She was chosen among some 300 actresses who auditioned to play the role of innocent yet sensual Eun-gyo. Looking for an actress that \"had to be ordinary and alive at the same time,\" Jung said he decided on Kim \"by discussing the book and her personal thoughts about Eun-gyo [...] What I liked about Go-eun was that she didn't try to impress me at all. She didn't try to please anybody. She didn't try to look pretty in front of the camera. She was just herself. That's what drew me to her.\" He flatteringly said she was similar to his previous \"Happy End\" leading lady, acclaimed actress Jeon Do-yeon. Novelist Park Bum-shin agreed that she was right for the role upon meeting her, saying, \"She was perfect for the forever virgin and forever young image that Eun-gyo symbolizes.\" Kim said of her film debut, \"It took a lot of courage to play this role. [...] I don't think physical beauty alone could have unleashed so much passion in a man who had lived for over 70 years with a heart of a stone. Eun-gyo is very spontaneous and is too innocent to have thought about the consequences of what she is doing, but she also has a mature side. She lacks parental care and love, so she desires this from a surrogate father figure, and becomes obsessed with the idea.\" Co-star Park Hae-il described her as \"fresh, dreamy and attractive.

But she's sort of feisty, badass and kicks butt. She gets to have a little going on with Leonardo. What I like about playing this character is she's not all bad. She has a conscience that she has to wrestle with...But see, I don't know about the other Karais or storylines in other series, so I don't know how it matches up, if it's the same or different or what.\" Asked about what she thinks \"makes Karai such a popular and unique character,\" Hu answered: \"I think people love these little tough girls.

She is introduced as a school friend of Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) and becomes a prominent and popular character during her tenure due to a combustible relationship with the soap's landlord, Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp). McCutcheon quit the role in 1998 to pursue a musical career. Introduced in 1995 by series producer Barbara Emile, Tiffany Raymond was conceptualised by \"EastEnders\" scriptwriter Tony Jordan as a school friend of already established character, Bianca Jackson. Actress Martine McCutcheon was cast in the role. McCutcheon has revealed that she was initially hesitant about auditioning for the part, commenting to \"The Guardian\", \"An agent called me and said there was a part on \"EastEnders\" and I said, very offhandedly, 'I don't really want to do soap, because I want to do movies, and nobody I know goes from soap to movies, and it's just not the sort of actress I want to be [...] this agent said to me, just let me send you a synopsis of the character and see what you think, and I thought she was fantastic.

The \"wit\" of the script appealed to Johnston due to her having to bury her father near Christmas, \"as did the chance of a lifetime to go to the frozen north\", what Johnston called, \"the icing on the cake\". Stephen Graham added, \"I remember Sue from when she was in \"Brookside\" and she's a legend. I\u2019ve always wanted to work with her.

Perez agreed, calling her \"great to work\" and \"so friendly\", adding \"you felt as if you had known her for years\". Wynne added, \"Sue is brilliant. She is so experienced that she just hits it \u2013 the comedy and the pathos. It is exactly what you were thinking and 100 times more\". Upon the announcement of the series, it was stated that Stephen Graham's character had been recast to \"Marchlands\" star Dean Andrews. Johnston said of this, \"I was very sad when I heard that Stephen wasn\u2019t going to do it, but then when I met Dean Andrews, all was forgiven. He's lovely\". Julie Graham was the first to sign up for the series. Barron who played Maurice was confirmed to return in a guest role. Johnston said of the Berrington's character Paula, \"Oh, she's always hysterical. And I think she thinks her mother's going loopy, but she's crazier than her mother. She's just always stressed out, and there's a lot of conflict between her and her brother, who's played by Dean. She's the sort of daughter who wants attention. Obviously, Pete has been the golden boy and there's a bit of tension between Eileen and Paula, as there often is between a mother and daughter, when there's a son involved. So all that adds to the drama\". The series focusses on Eileen's \"tough\" time being apart from her deceased husband Ted. Johnston said that Eileen is trying to \"get on with her life\" after his death. She said, \"In doing so, she meets opposition from the family who think she has gone a bit loopy. They have never seen the fact that she can be strong and independent. She goes to a Rihanna concert with an old friend and becomes a lot more adventurous but her family starts to wonder what is going on\".", "Lucy Hutchinson (actress) .

Her film debut came when she filmed scenes for the American film \"Prometheus\", in which she played a younger version of the main character, Elizabeth Shaw. Hutchinson said \"It was really good and I think the experience was great for me as well. It was filming at Pinewood, it is such a big place and that showed me what other sets were being built there which was good. I have never really been to a big set before, I just thought 'wow'. I know it was a big scene, Ridley Scott told me it was a really big scene. I was quite confident and just thought 'yeah I am going to do this'.\"", "Tiffany Mitchell .

Actress Dana Delany, who previously played a lesbian character in the Showtime series \"The L Word\", said she felt the subplot was an excellent idea: \"A lot of the ladies on the set have said, 'Why has this not happened before?' I think everybody wanted to be the one who got to do it.\" In an interview with \"E! Online\", actress Marcia Cross jokingly said of the kiss scene, \"I'm a little jealous that I'm not involved. What is going on?\" Delany said she did not know if the character would become a lesbian permanently, because the story lines change so often in \"Desperate Housewives\", but that series creator Marc Cherry \"is interested in playing the complexity of that\". The pairing between Robin and Katherine was the first lesbian relationship in \"Desperate Housewives\".", "Charlie Brooks . In 2008, Brooks returned to \"EastEnders\" for a guest stint.

Realising that \"U2 had no tradition\" and that their knowledge of music from before their childhood was limited, the group delved into American and Irish roots music. Friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Keith Richards motivated Bono to explore blues, folk, and gospel music and focused him on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. U2 halted the album sessions in June 1986 to serve as a headline act on the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert tour for Amnesty International. Rather than distract the band, the tour invigourated their new material. The following month, Bono travelled to Nicaragua and El Salvador and saw first-hand the distress of peasants affected by political conflicts and US military intervention. The experience became a central influence on their new music. \"The Joshua Tree\" was released in March 1987.

The band wanted music with a sense of location and a \"cinematic\" quality, and the record's music and lyrics draw on imagery created by American writers whose works the band had been reading. \"The Joshua Tree\" was critically acclaimed; Robert Hilburn of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said the album \"confirms on record what this band has been slowly asserting for three years now on stage: U2 is what the Rolling Stones ceased being years ago\u2014the greatest rock and roll band in the world\".

Kundera is more concerned with the words that shape or mold his characters than with their physical appearance. In his non-fiction work, \"The Art of the Novel\", he says that the reader's imagination automatically completes the writer's vision. He, as the writer, thus wishes to focus on the essential, arguing that the physical is not critical to understanding a character. Indeed, for him the essential may not even include the interior world (the psychological world) of his characters. Still, at times, a specific feature or trait may become the character's idiosyncratic focus.", "Milan Kundera . Kundera considers himself a writer without a message. In \"Sixty-three Words,\" a chapter in \"The Art of the Novel\", Kundera recounts an episode when a Scandinavian publisher hesitated about going ahead with \"The Farewell Party\" because of its apparent anti-abortion message.

Kundera is a cousin of Czech writer and translator Ludv\u00edk Kundera.

Graphic images of oil wells in Kuwait on fire after the First Gulf War after their wellheads were removed, demonstrate the perils of not using the components (at the time, they were deemed unnecessary because they were onshore wells). It is, however, not a direct legal requirement in many places. In the United Kingdom, no law mandates the use of DHSVs. However, the 1974 Health & Safety at Work Act & The Offshore Installations and Wells (Design and Construction etc) Regulations 1996 [DCR1996 together require that measures are taken to ensure that the uncontrolled release of wellbore fluids is prevented even in the worst case. The brilliance of the act is that it does not issue prescriptive guideline for how to achieve the goal of health and safety, but merely sets out the requirement that the goal be achieved. It is up to the oil companies to decide how to achieve it and DHSVs are an important component of that decision. As such, although not a legal requirement, it is company policy for many operators in the UKCS.", "United States energy independence . In 1973 Canada created its own state energy company Petro-Canada. It began operations in 1976, though it bought assets from private companies rather than seizing them as in many other countries. In 1980 the National Energy Program was launched to create oil self-sufficiency within Canada. It attempted to use tax incentives to discourage oil exports (mostly from Western Canada, primarily the province of Alberta) to the US, and redirect these towards to the oil importing provinces of Eastern Canada. The Foreign Investment Review Agency was also created to screen foreign (mostly U.S.) takeovers of Canadian companies. These policies were bitterly opposed by the provincial government of Alberta, and were repealed and reversed during the Conservative government of 1984\u20131993 which sought closer economic ties with the U.S., including the Canada\u2013US Free Trade Agreement of 1988.", "Production sharing agreement . Production sharing agreements (PSAs) are a common type of contract signed between a government and a resource extraction company (or group of companies) concerning how much of the resource (usually oil) extracted from the country each will receive. Production sharing agreements were first used in Bolivia in the early 1950s, although their first implementation similar to today's was in Indonesia in the 1960s. Today they are often used in the Middle East and Central Asia. In production sharing agreements the country's government awards the execution of exploration and production activities to an oil company. The oil company bears the mineral and financial risk of the initiative and explores, develops and ultimately produces the field as required. When successful, the company is permitted to use the money from produced oil to recover capital and operational expenditures, known as \"cost oil\". The remaining money is known as \"profit oil\", and is split between the government and the company. In most of the production sharing agreements, changes in international oil prices or production rate affect the company's share of production.  Production sharing agreements can be beneficial to governments of countries that lack the expertise and/or capital to develop their resources and wish to attract foreign companies to do so. They can be very profitable agreements for the oil companies involved, but often involve considerable risk.", "John Henry Fairbank .

Texaco bought Getty Oil in 1984, and with it the operations on the Zaca field.

Greka bought the field from Vintage in August 2002, and remains the principal operator as of 2011, though now under the name HVI Cat Canyon, Inc.", "Nationalization of oil supplies . The nationalization of oil supplies refers to the process of confiscation of oil production operations and private property, generally in the purpose of obtaining more revenue from oil for oil-producing countries' governments. This process, which should not be confused with restrictions on crude oil exports, represents a significant turning point in the development of oil policy. Nationalization eliminates private business operations\u2014in which private international companies control oil resources within oil-producing countries\u2014and allows oil-producing countries to gain control of private property. Once these countries become the sole owners of these confiscated resources in violation of contract law, they have to decide how to maximize the net present value of their known stock of oil in the ground. Several key implications can be observed as a result of oil nationalization. \"On the home front, national oil companies are often torn between national expectations that they should 'carry the flag' and their own ambitions for commercial success, which might mean a degree of emancipation from the confines of a national agenda.\""], "ground_truth": "100 countries", "answer": "Seven countries: Oregon, Washington, Idaho, California, Arizona, Colorado, and Minnesota."}

The invention was named after the city.", "Leyden jar . The Leyden jar's invention was long credited to Pieter van Musschenbroek, the physics professor at University of Leiden, who also ran a family foundry which cast brass cannonettes, and a small business (\"De Oosterse Lamp\" \u2013 \"The Eastern Lamp\") which made scientific and medical instruments for the new university courses in physics and for scientific gentlemen keen to establish their own 'cabinets' of curiosities and instruments.", "Georg Matthias Bose . Von Kleist had invented the Leyden Jar, but he did not understand the significance of his cupped hand held around the outside of the bottle which provided the one exterior conductive element needed to allow the Leyden Jar to accumulate a massive amount of charge.", "Ewald Georg von Kleist . On 11 October 1745 he independently invented the Kleistian jar which could store electricity in large quantities. He communicated this discovery to a group of Berlin scientists in late 1745, and the news was transferred in a confused form to Leyden University where it was further investigated. This became more commonly known as the Leyden jar after graduate student Pieter van Musschenbroek of Leyden.", "List of Dutch inventions and discoveries . The idea for the Leyden jar was discovered independently by two parties: German scientist and jurist Ewald Georg von Kleist, and Dutchmen Pieter van Musschenbroek and Andreas Cunaeus. These scientists developed the Leyden jar while working under a theory of electricity that saw electricity as a fluid, and hoped to develop the jar to \"capture\" this fluid. In 1744 von Kleist lined a glass jar with silver foil, and charged the foil with a friction machine. Kleist was convinced that a substantial electric charge could be collected when he received a significant shock from the device. The effects of this \"Kleistian jar\" were independently discovered around the same time by Dutch scientists Pieter van Musschenbroek and Cunaeus at the University of Leiden. Van Musschenbroek communicated on it with the French scientific community where it was called the Leyden jar.", "List of Dutch inventions and discoveries . A Leyden jar, or Leiden jar, is a device that \"stores\" static electricity between two electrodes on the inside and outside of a glass jar. It was the original form of a capacitor (originally known as a \"condenser\"). It was invented independently by German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist on 11 October 1745 and by Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek of Leiden (Leyden) in 1745\u20131746. The invention was named for the city. The Leyden jar was used to conduct many early experiments in electricity, and its discovery was of fundamental importance in the study of electricity. Previously, researchers had to resort to insulated conductors of large dimensions to store a charge. The Leyden jar provided a much more compact alternative. Like many early electrical devices, there was no particular use for the Leyden jar at first, other than to allow scientists to do a greater variety of electrical experiments. Benjamin Franklin, for example, used a Leyden jar to store electricity from lightning in his famous kite experiment in 1752. By doing so he proved that lightning was really electricity.", "Leyden jar . Like Kleist, Musschenbroek was also interested in and attempting to repeat Bose's experiment. During this time, Andreas Cuneaus, a lawyer, came to learn about this experiment from visiting Musschenbroek's laboratory and Cuneaus attempted to duplicate the experiment at home with household items. Using a glass of beer, Cunaeus was unable to make it work. Cunaeus was the first to discover that the experimental setup could deliver a severe shock when he held his jar in his hand while charging it rather than placing it on an insulated stand, not realising that was the standard practice, thus making himself part of the circuit. He reported his procedure and experience to Allamand, Musschenbroek's colleague. Allamand and Musschenbroek also received severe shocks. Musschenbroek communicated the experiment in a letter from 20 January 1746 to Ren\u00e9 Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur, who was Musschenbroek's appointed correspondent at the Paris Academy. Abb\u00e9 Nollet read this report, confirmed the experiment, and then read Musschenbroek's letter in a public meeting of the Paris Academy in April 1746 (translating from Latin to French).  Musschenbroek's outlet in France for the sale of his company's 'cabinet' devices was the Abb\u00e9 Nollet (who started building and selling duplicate instruments in 1735). Nollet then gave the electrical storage device the name \"Leyden jar\" and promoted it as a special type of flask to his market of wealthy men with scientific curiosity. The \"Kleistian jar\" was therefore promoted as the \"Leyden jar\" as having been discovered by Pieter van Musschenbroek and his acquaintance Andreas Cunaeus, though Musschenbroek never claimed that he had invented it, and some think that Cunaeus was mentioned only to diminish credit to Musschenbroek.", "History of electromagnetic theory . The Leyden jar, a type of capacitor for electrical energy in large quantities, was invented independently by Ewald Georg von Kleist on 11 October 1744 and by Pieter van Musschenbroek in 1745\u20141746 at Leiden University (the latter location giving the device its name). William Watson, when experimenting with the Leyden jar, discovered in 1747 that a discharge of static electricity was equivalent to an electric current. Capacitance was first observed by Von Kleist of Leyden in 1754. Von Kleist happened to hold, near his electric machine, a small bottle, in the neck of which there was an iron nail. Touching the iron nail accidentally with his other hand he received a severe electric shock. In much the same way Musschenbroeck assisted by Cunaens received a more severe shock from a somewhat similar glass bottle. Sir William Watson of England greatly improved this device, by covering the bottle, or jar, outside and in with tinfoil. This piece of electrical apparatus will be easily recognized as the well-known Leyden jar, so called by the Abbot Nollet of Paris, after the place of its discovery.", "Experiments and Observations on Electricity . Franklin explained in these letters that in an experiment he did show that the charge was in the glass itself and not in the water within the jar, as had been theorized by others. After a Leyden jar was charged he poured the water from it into another Leyden jar that was not charged. It turned out the electric force was not \"condensed\" in the water itself, as the new Leyden jar had no charge with this water from the first Leyden jar. Then the first jar was refilled with fresh water and it was discovered that there was a charge in this jar. The conclusion then was that it was the glass itself that was the condenser of the electric force. It was further determined by more experimentation that it did not matter what shape the glass was in or if an object was shaped like a glass bottle. It was finally determined that a property of the glass itself was this \"force\" of equal and opposite charges.", "Analogue filter . Resonance was noticed early on in experiments with the Leyden jar, invented in 1746. The Leyden jar stores electricity due to its capacitance, and is, in fact, an early form of capacitor. When a Leyden jar is discharged by allowing a spark to jump between the electrodes, the discharge is oscillatory. This was not suspected until 1826, when Felix Savary in France, and later (1842) Joseph Henry in the US noted that a steel needle placed close to the discharge does not always magnetise in the same direction.

Brun would later communicate with England through Einar Skinnarland, a covert Special Operations Executive agent hailing from Rjukan. In October 1942, Brun was summoned to England, reportedly at the request of Winston Churchill. Instead, a team of agents were parachuted into the area to gather more intelligence, under the codename Operation Grouse.", "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons . U.S. nuclear sharing policies were originally designed to help prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons\u2014not least by persuading the then West Germany not to develop an independent nuclear capability by assuring it that West Germany would be able, in the event of war with the Warsaw Pact, to wield (U.S.) nuclear weapons in self-defense. (Until that point of all-out war, however, the weapons themselves would remain in U.S. hands.) The point was to limit the spread of countries having their own nuclear weapons programs, helping ensure that NATO allies would not choose to go down the proliferation route. (West Germany was discussed in U.S. intelligence estimates for a number of years as being a country with the potential to develop nuclear weapons capabilities of its own if officials in Bonn were not convinced that their defense against the Soviet Union and its allies could otherwise be met.)", "Nunn\u2013Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction . The Cooperative Threat Reduction Act was a major contributor to De-Escalation of nuclear weapon arsenals. This program was used for \"the transportation, storage, safeguarding and destruction of nuclear and other weapons in the Soviet Union\u2026 and to assist in the prevention of weapons proliferation\". One contribution by the Nunn-Lugar program has been the \"delivery of equipment to accelerate the dismantlement of strategic nuclear delivery vehicles\" to the Soviet Union. This program made important contributions in the disarmament of nuclear warheads in many counties. The Nunn-Lugar program eliminated former strategic weapons outside of Russia. This was most evident in the removal of these weapons in Ukraine. There were many countries that had Soviet Union nuclear weapons. Two others included Belarus and Kazakhstan. The Cooperative Threat Reduction Act helped Russia move the nuclear arsenals in these countries back to Russia or dismembering these weapons in these countries. The United States sent \"nearly 700 emergency response items to help guarantee safe and secure transportation of nuclear weapons\" to Belarus for the aid of the elimination of nuclear power in this country. The Cooperative Threat Reduction Act played a major role in a huge decrease in the quantity of nuclear weapons that had been stockpiled during the nuclear escalation period.", "International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War . IPPNW was founded in 1980 by physicians from the United States and the Soviet Union who shared a common commitment to the prevention of nuclear war between their two countries. Citing the first principle of the medical profession \u2014 that doctors have an obligation to prevent what they cannot treat \u2014 a global federation of physician experts came together to explain the medical and scientific facts about nuclear war to policy makers and to the public, and to advocate for the elimination of nuclear weapons from the world\u2019s arsenals.", "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons . Because the availability of fissile material has long been considered the principal obstacle to, and \"pacing element\" for, a country's nuclear weapons development effort, it was declared a major emphasis of U.S. policy in 2004 to prevent the further spread of uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing (a.k.a. \"ENR\") technology. Countries possessing ENR capabilities, it is feared, have what is in effect the option of using this capability to produce fissile material for weapons use on demand, thus giving them what has been termed a \"virtual\" nuclear weapons program. The degree to which NPT members have a \"right\" to ENR technology notwithstanding its potentially grave proliferation implications, therefore, is at the cutting edge of policy and legal debates surrounding the meaning of Article IV and its relation to Articles I, II, and III of the treaty.", "Jomar Brun . Jomar Brun MBE (18 June 1904 \u2013 26 August 1993) was a Norwegian chemical engineer. He was born in Trondheim.

He was central in the planning and running of the world's first industrial heavy water plant at Norsk Hydro Rjukan. During World War II he was called to London, and contributed to the planning phase of Operation Freshman and Operation Gunnerside, the heavy water sabotage at Vemork. He was decorated with the Order of the British Empire, and Officer of the French Legion of Honour. From 1951 he was appointed professor of electrochemistry at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim.", "Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons . Among the countries voting for the treaty's adoption were South Africa and Kazakhstan, both of which formerly possessed nuclear weapons and gave them up voluntarily. Iran and Saudi Arabia also voted in favour of the agreement. There are indications that Saudi Arabia has financially contributed to Pakistan's atomic bomb projects and in return has the option to buy a small nuclear arsenal, an option that would be realized in the event that Iran obtains nuclear warheads. The aim of the Iran nuclear deal from 2015 was to prevent this case.", "Permissive Action Link . Newer nuclear weapons were simpler in their operation and were produced en masse and were less cumbersome to arm and use than previous designs. Accordingly, new controls were necessary to prevent their unauthorized use. As the Cold War came to a head in the 1960s, the government felt it best not to leave the use of nuclear weapons in the hands of possibly-renegade generals, including the commander of Strategic Air Command (SAC). Without Permissive Action Links, nuclear weapons were effectively under the independent command of a number of generals.", "Nuclear weapon . Nuclear warfare strategy is a set of policies that deal with preventing or fighting a nuclear war. The policy of trying to prevent an attack by a nuclear weapon from another country by threatening nuclear retaliation is known as the strategy of nuclear deterrence. The goal in deterrence is to always maintain a second strike capability (the ability of a country to respond to a nuclear attack with one of its own) and potentially to strive for first strike status (the ability to destroy an enemy's nuclear forces before they could retaliate). During the Cold War, policy and military theorists considered the sorts of policies that might prevent a nuclear attack, and they developed game theory models that could lead to stable deterrence conditions."], "ground_truth": "prevent the German nuclear weapon project", "answer": "Germany."}

Although importation of enslaved persons into the United States had been illegal since 1808, Meaher may have believed that he could flout the law without consequences. Some reports suggest that breaking the law was part of Meaher's motivation for importing the slaves, as he reportedly bet a businessman $100,000 that he could circumvent the prohibition on transporting slaves. In a similar situation, the owners of the \"Wanderer,\" which had illegally brought a cargo of enslaved people to Georgia in 1858, were indicted and tried for piracy in the federal court in Savannah in May 1860 but acquitted in a jury trial. By the time the \"Clotilda\" reached the Mississippi coast in July 1860, government officials had been alerted to its activities, and Timothy Meaher, his brother Burns, and their associate John Dabney were charged with illegal possession of the captives. However, there was a gap of almost five months between the end of July 1860, when summonses and writs of seizure were issued against the Meahers and Dabney, and mid-December when they received them.

The new protocol for manufacturing long guns included five lengths that ranged from seven feet to nine feet in length.

It is generally served with bread dumplings (houskov\u00e9 knedl\u00edky) and cranberry sauce. Note: In most restaurants and canteens the staff actually boils the beef, instead of baking it.", "Pierogi . \"Lazy varenyky\" (, ) in Russian and Ukrainian cuisine or \"leniwe pyrohy\" in Rusyn are gnocchi-shaped dumplings made by mixing tvoroh (curd cheese) with egg and flour into quick dough. The cheese-based dough is formed into a long sausage about 2\u00a0cm thick, which is cut diagonally into gnocchi, called halushky in Ukrainian and Rusyn, \"galushki\" in Russian. The dumplings are then quickly boiled in salted water and served with sour cream or melted butter. The name \"lazy varenyky\" faithfully reflects the very quick preparation time of the dish: It usually takes 10 to 15 minutes from assembling the simple ingredients to serving the cooked dumplings. Lazy varenyky differ from standard varenyky in the same way that Italian gnocchi differ from ravioli or tortellini: these are fluffy solid dumplings, not stuffed pockets of dough. The same dish in Polish cuisine is called \"lazy pierogi\" ().", "Korean regional cuisine . Savory grain dishes are numerous, and include \"sujebi\" (dumpling soup), and \"beombeok\" (thick mixed-grain porridge). They are made with either pumpkin, potato, corn, wheat flour, or azuki beans. Noodle soups such as \"Jemul guksu\" (noodles in soybean paste soup), and \"memilkal ssakdugi\" (knife-cut noodle soup) also have a thick broth and a savory taste along with a soft texture in contrast with \"naeongmyeon\" in the clear \"dongchimi\" broth eaten in the northern region. \"Naengkongguk\" (soybean soup with dumplings) is also a common dish which is also a local specialty of Chungcheong and Hwanghae provinces. Cuisine in the capital city of Seoul is extravagantly presented, and prepared according to strict quality rules. Meals are served in small portions and include many dishes. Their cooking uses many seasonings, but the taste is not overly spicy. Typical main dishes include: \"seolleongtang\" (beef soup with rice), \"gukbap\" (soup with rice), \"tteokguk\" (rice cake soup), \"heukimjajuk\" (black sesame porridge), \"jatjuk\" (pine nut porridge), \"memil mandu\" (dumpling with a buckwheat covering), \"saengchi mandu\" (dumpling stuffed with pheasant meat), and \"pyeonsu\" (square-shaped mandu with vegetable filling). Among them, \"seolleongtang\" is the most widely known Seoul dish, and is also popular nationwide. It is said to be strongly associated with the Seonnongdan shrine in the neighborhood of Jegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul where the kings of Korea held an annual national ritual to pray for a good harvest. After the ritual everyone gathered to eat a beef soup together, which was made by boiling beef and its tripe in dozens of \"gamasots\" (cauldrons) with water.", "Chicken and dumplings . Various commercial preparations of chicken and dumplings are available, including canned and frozen versions of the prepared dish. Frozen raw dumplings, typically very flat strips about 1x4 inches, can be cooked in any broth. The consistency of the prepared dish, whether homemade or purchased, varies from a thin soup to a very thick casserole-like consistency, easily eaten with a fork. Thicker preparations are made by gently simmering the dumplings longer and/or adding flour or another thickening agent directly to the broth. Flour tortillas or canned biscuits, rolled thin on a floured surface, cut into strips, are a quick and easy substitute for homemade dough. Butter may be added to the recipe for added richness. Since chicken meat would become dry and tough if it is boiled long enough to cook the dumplings and thicken the broth, the chicken or parts are removed from the broth before adding the dumplings. While the dumplings are cooking, the meat is separated from the bones. When the dumplings are done and the broth seasoned and thickened, the chicken is returned to the broth. The dish is then ready to be served, but may be kept on low heat so as to not further cook the chicken.", "Sv\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 . Bohemian immigrants to the United States following the First World War have passed on an older variation of the dish to subsequent generations, while regional tastes and product availability have influenced its preparation.

Although there are many different variations of manti in terms of shape and way of serving, the most praised type of Turkish manti is known as \"Kayseri mantisi\", originally from Kayseri, an Anatolian city. \"Kayseri mantisi\" is tiny and served with yoghurt, melted butter (flavored with Aleppo pepper) and seasoning including dry mint and Aleppo pepper flakes. It can also be served with the water or chicken broth it was boiled in, and often in Kayseri it is consumed as a soup prior to the main dish. In Kayseri, when a couple is engaged to be married, the mother of the groom visits the bride's house and during this visit the bride should prepare manti for her prospective mother-in-law. The smaller the manti dumplings are, the more skillful the bride is considered to be in the kitchen. Traditionally the dumplings prepared for the prospective mother-in law are supposed to be so small that 40 of them can be fit into one spoon. Manti may be made from shredded meat of quail, chicken or goose in some regions of Turkey, while \"bo\u015f mant\u0131\" (\u2018empty dumpling\u2019) lack filling entirely.", "Cabbage . Cabbage is prepared and consumed in many ways. The simplest options include eating the vegetable raw or steaming it, though many cuisines pickle, stew, saut\u00e9e or braise cabbage. Pickling is one of the most popular ways of preserving cabbage, creating dishes such as sauerkraut and kimchi, although kimchi is more often made from Chinese cabbage (\"B.\u00a0rapa\"). Savoy cabbages are usually used in salads, while smooth-leaf types are utilized for both market sales and processing. Bean curd and cabbage is a staple of Chinese cooking, while the British dish bubble and squeak is made primarily with leftover potato and boiled cabbage and eaten with cold meat. In Poland, cabbage is one of the main food crops, and it features prominently in Polish cuisine. It is frequently eaten, either cooked or as sauerkraut, as a side dish or as an ingredient in such dishes as bigos (cabbage, sauerkraut, meat, and wild mushrooms, among other ingredients) go\u0142\u0105bki (stuffed cabbage) and pierogi (filled dumplings). Other eastern European countries, such as Hungary and Romania, also have traditional dishes that feature cabbage as a main ingredient. In India and Ethiopia, cabbage is often included in spicy salads and braises. In the United States, cabbage is used primarily for the production of coleslaw, followed by market use and sauerkraut production.", "Adolf Hitler and vegetarianism . Prior to the Second World War, there are many accounts of Hitler eating meat, including stuffed squab, Bavarian sausages and caviar. According to Ilse Hess, in 1937 Hitler ceased eating all meat except for liver dumplings, an account that Dr. Kalechofsky found \"consistent with other descriptions of Hitler's diet, which always included some form of meat, whether ham, sausages or liver dumplings.\" Frau Hess's comments are also backed up by several biographies about Hitler, with Fritz Redlich noting that Hitler \"avoided any kind of meat, with the exception of an Austrian dish he loved, Leberkn\u00f6dl (liver dumpling)\". Thomas Fuchs concurred, observing that a \"typical day's consumption included eggs prepared in any number of ways, spaghetti, baked potatoes with cottage cheese, oatmeal, stewed fruits and vegetable puddings. Meat was not completely excluded. Hitler continued to eat a favourite dish, Leberkloesse (liver dumplings).\"", "Chicken and dumplings . Although the dumpling has been around for many generations, each culture has its own way of individualizing the basic dumpling recipe. There are other international versions of chicken and dumplings. For instance, the Chinese culture has the wonton, which is similar to the chicken and dumplings dish as we know it today.

But it was not yet to be. In 1860 the renowned French Ballet Master Arthur Saint-L\u00e9on was given the coveted position by the director of the Imperial Theatres Andrei Saburov, and soon a healthy and productive rivalry between him and Petipa ensued, bringing the Imperial Ballet to new heights throughout the 1860s.", "Her Majesty's Theatre .

She performed for a number of acclaimed seasons at the theatre, interspersed with national tours, becoming known as the \"Swedish Nightingale\". The secession of the orchestra to Covent Garden was a blow, and the theatre closed in 1852, re-opening in 1856, when a fire closed its rival. After the reopening, Lumley presented two more British premieres of Verdi operas: \"La traviata\" in 1856 and \"Luisa Miller\" in 1858. From the early 1830s until the late 1840s Her Majesty's Theatre played host to the heyday of the era of the romantic ballet, and the theatre's resident ballet company was considered the most renowned in Europe, aside from the Ballet du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique in Paris. The celebrated ballet master Jules Perrot began staging ballet at Her Majesty's in 1830. Lumley appointed him \"Premier Ma\u00eetre de Ballet\" (chief choreographer) to the theatre in 1842. Among the works of ballet that he staged were \"Ondine, ou La Na\u00efade\" (1843), \"La Esmeralda\" (1844), and \"Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit\" (1846), as well as the celebrated divertissement \"Pas de Quatre\" (1845). Other ballet masters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic ballet, most notably Paul Taglioni (son of Filippo Taglioni), who staged ballets including \"Coralia, ou Le Chevalier inconstant\" (1847) and \"Electra\" (1849, the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting). Arthur Saint-L\u00e9on staged such works as \"La Vivandi\u00e8re\" (1844), \"Le Violin du Diable\" (1849), and \"Le Jugement de P\u00e2ris\" (1850), which was considered a sequel of sorts to \"Pas de Quatre\".", "Dance notation .

By the mid-1860s the composer was nearing the end of his life and prolific career. As the decade drew to a close he became increasingly unreliable due to his severe alcoholism, often putting off composing to the last minute and supplying music of an increasingly poor and banal quality.

Michael Aherne is the only cast member to have not pursued an acting career after the film's release.", "Frame rate . Early silent films had stated frame rates anywhere from 16 to 24 frames per second (fps), but since the cameras were hand-cranked, the rate often changed during the scene to fit the mood. Projectionists could also change the frame rate in the theater by adjusting a rheostat controlling the voltage powering the film-carrying mechanism in the projector. Film companies often intended that theaters show their silent films at higher frame rates than they were filmed at. These frame rates were enough for the sense of motion, but it was perceived as jerky motion. To minimize the perceived flicker, projectors employed dual- and triple-blade shutters, so each frame was displayed two or three times, increasing the flicker rate to 48 or 72 Hertz and reducing eye strain. Thomas Edison said that 46 frames per second was the minimum needed for the eye to perceive motion: \"Anything less will strain the eye.\" In the mid to late 1920s, the frame rate for silent films increased to between 20 and 26\u00a0fps.", "A Silent Film . The band formed in 2005. Three of the five members (Robert Stevenson, Spencer Walker and Lewis Jones) had been members of another band named Shouting Myke, which formed in early 2000. In 2005 two members (Benn Clarke and Steve Meyer-Rassow) left the band and were replaced by Ali Hussain, whose older brother is noted classical conductor Leo Hussain. The newly formed band chose the name A Silent Film after lead singer Stevenson wrote a song using the melody from a song from a Charlie Chaplin film; the band agreed they liked the style and chose the name as a reference to Chaplin's many silent films. The band released their first recording in 2007, an EP titled \"The Projectionist\". They performed on the BBC Introducing Stage at Glastonbury in 2007.", "Movie projector . Silent films usually were not projected at constant speeds, but rather were varied throughout the show at the discretion of the projectionist, often with some notes provided by the distributor. This was more a function of hand-cranked projectors than the silence. When the electric motor supplanted hand cranking in both movie cameras and projectors, a more uniform frame rate became possible. Speeds ranged from about 18 frame/s on up - sometimes even faster than modern sound film speed (24 frame/s).", "Academy ratio . Silent films were shot at a 1.33 aspect ratio (also known as a 4:3 aspect ratio), with each frame using all of the negative space between the two rows of film perforations for a length of 4 perfs. The frame line between the silent film frames was very thin. When sound-on-film was introduced in the late 1920s, the soundtrack was recorded in a stripe running just inside of one set of the perforations and cut into the 1.33 image. This made the image area \"taller\", usually around 1.19, which was slightly disorienting to audiences used to the 1.33 frame and also presented problems for exhibitors with fixed-size screens and stationary projectors.", "Modern Times (film) . Chaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first \"talkie\", and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However, he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects and sparse dialogue. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of his \"Little Tramp\" character would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen. Most of the film was shot at \"silent speed\", 18 frames per second, which when projected at \"sound speed\", 24 frames per second, made the slapstick action appear even more frenetic. The duration of filming was long for the time, beginning on October 11, 1934, and ending on August 30, 1935.", "Film frame . The most common film format, [[35 mm]], has a frame size of 36 by 24\u00a0mm when used in a still 35\u00a0mm camera where the film moves horizontally, but the frame size varies when used for motion picture where the film moves vertically (with the exception of [[VistaVision]] and [[Technirama]] where the film moves horizontally). Using a [[4-perf pulldown]], there are exactly 16 frames in one foot of 35\u00a0mm film, leading to film frames sometimes being counted in terms of \"[[feet and frames]]\". The maximum frame size is 18 by 24\u00a0mm, (silent/full aperture), but this is significantly reduced by the application of sound track(s). A system called [[KeyKode]] is often used to identify specific physical film frames in a production.", "Reel . It is traditional to discuss the length of theatrical motion pictures in terms of \"reels\". The standard length of a 35 mm film reel is , which runs approximately 11 minutes for sound film (24 frames per second) and about 15 minutes for silent film at the more-or-less standard speed of 16 frames per second. Most films have visible cues which mark the end of the reel. This allows projectionists running reel-to-reel to change over to the next reel on the other projector.", "Academy ratio . The Academy ratio is not created in the camera, which has continued to use the full frame silent aperture gate for all 4-perf spherical filming. Rather, it is created in the married print, when the optical soundtrack and frame lines are added. Though most non-anamorphic film prints with a soundtrack are now framed to one of the non-anamorphic widescreen ratios, from 1.66 to 1.85, some still retain Academy-sized frames. These frames are then cropped in the projector by means of aperture masks used in the projector's gate in conjunction with a wider lens than would be used for projecting Academy ratio films.", "Footage . The origin of the term \"footage\" is that early 35 mm silent film has traditionally been measured in feet and frames; the fact that film was measured by length in cutting rooms, and that there are 16 frames (4-perf film format) in a foot of 35 mm film which roughly represented 1 second of silent film, made footage a natural unit of measure for film. The term then became used figuratively to describe moving image material of any kind."], "ground_truth": "The Frames", "answer": "The Frames has more members than A Silent Film."}

Henricus Antonius \"Han\" van Meegeren (; 10 October 1889 \u2013 30 December 1947) was a Dutch painter and portraitist and is considered to be one of the most ingenious art forgers of the 20th century. Despite his life of crime, van Meegeren became a national hero after World War Two when it was revealed that he had sold a forged painting to Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00f6ring during the Nazi Occupation of the Netherlands.", "Han van Meegeren . Han (a diminutive version of Henri or Henricus) van Meegeren was born in 1889 as the third of five children of middle-class Roman Catholic parents in the provincial city of Deventer. He was the son of Augusta Louisa Henrietta Camps and Hendrikus Johannes van Meegeren, a French and history teacher at the Kweekschool (training college for schoolteachers) in the city of Deventer.", "Keith Coventry . The \"Repressionism\" \"Series\" came about after Coventry read a book on the infamous art forger Han van Meegeren at the London Library. Van Meegeren had successfully forged and sold on works in the style of Johannes Vermeer, even duping the Nazi Hermann G\u00f6ring. Coventry then considered how easy it would be to fake a painting himself, choosing the expressionist painter Emil Nolde because he thought his seemingly simple style would be easy to counterfeit. He then took a painting of the head of Christ that Van Meegeren had executed as part of a study for the Dutch artist's take on The Last Supper, a work Vermeer never in fact painted. The Jesus heads (example: right) are executed in a colour spectrum and the frames are the same type used by the German expressionists.", "Frederik H. Kreuger . The resulting English biography \"A New Vermeer. Life and Work of Han van Meegeren\" 2007 was named after a notorious article \"A New Vermeer\", where the great art-expert Dr. Abraham Bredius praised the Van Meegeren fake \"Emmaus\" as the finest Vermeer painting ever seen. <br>In this book he also describes the life of Van Meegeren's son Jacques van Meegeren; he discovered that Jacques in his turn had forged the work of his father.", "Han van Meegeren . A Dutch opinion poll conducted in October 1947 placed Han van Meegeren\u2019s popularity second in the nation, behind only the Prime Minister's and slightly ahead of Prince Berhard, the husband of Princess Juliana. The Dutch people viewed Van Meegeren as a cunning trickster who had successfully fooled the Dutch art experts and, more importantly, Hermann G\u00f6ring himself. In fact, according to a contemporary account, G\u00f6ring was informed that his \"Vermeer\" was actually a forgery and \"[G\u00f6ring] looked as if for the first time he had discovered there was evil in the world\". Lopez indicates that Han van Meegeren's defense during his trial in Amsterdam was a masterpiece of trickery, forging his own personality into a true Dutchman eager to trick his critics and also the Dutch people by pretending that he sold \"Christ and the Adulteress\", a fake Vermeer, to G\u00f6ring because he wanted to teach the Nazi a lesson. Van Meegeren remains one of the most ingenious art counterfeiters of the 20th century. After his trial, however, he declared, \"My triumph as a counterfeiter was my defeat as [a] creative artist.\"", "Han van Meegeren . The trial of Han van Meegeren began on 29 October 1947 in Room 4 of the Regional Court in Amsterdam. The collaboration charges had been dropped, since the expert panel had found that the \"Vermeer\" sold to Hermann G\u00f6ring had been a forgery and was, therefore, not the cultural property of the Netherlands. Public prosecutor H. A. Wassenbergh brought charges of forgery and fraud and demanded a sentence of two years in prison. The court commissioned an international group of experts to address the authenticity of van Meegeren's paintings. The commission included curators, professors, and doctors from the Netherlands, Belgium, and England, and was led by the director of the chemical laboratory at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Paul B. Coremans. The commission examined the eight Vermeer and Frans Hals paintings which van Meegeren had identified as forgeries. With the help of the commission, Dr. Coremans was able to determine the chemical composition of van Meegeren's paints. He found that van Meegeren had prepared the paints by using the phenolformaldehyde resins Bakelite and Albertol as paint hardeners. A bottle with exactly that ingredient had been found in van Meegeren's studio. This chemical component was introduced and manufactured in the 20th century, proving that the \"Vermeers\" and \"Frans Halses\" examined by the commission were in fact made by van Meegeren. The commission's other findings suggested that the dust in the craquelure was too homogeneous to be of natural origin. The matter found in the craquelure appeared to come from India ink, which had accumulated even in areas that natural dirt or dust would never have reached. The paint had become so hard that alcohol, strong acids, and bases did not attack the surface, a clear indication that the surface had not been formed in a natural manner. The craquelure on the surface did not always match that in the ground layer, which would certainly have been the case with a natural craquelure. Thus, the test results obtained by the commission appeared to confirm that the works were forgeries created by van Meegeren, but their authenticity continued to be debated by some of the experts until 1967 and 1977, when new investigative techniques were used to analyze the paintings (see below).", "Han van Meegeren . As a child, van Meegeren developed an enthusiasm for the paintings of the Dutch Golden Age, and later set out to become an artist himself. Art critics, however, decried his work as tired and derivative, and van Meegeren felt that they had destroyed his career. He decided to prove his talent to the critics by forging paintings of some of the world's most famous artists, including Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Gerard ter Borch, and Johannes Vermeer. He so well replicated the styles and colours of the artists that the best art critics and experts of the time regarded his paintings as genuine and sometimes exquisite. His most successful forgery was \"Supper at Emmaus\", created in 1937 while living in the south of France. This painting was hailed as a real Vermeer by famous art experts such as Abraham Bredius. Bredius acclaimed it as \"\"the\" masterpiece of Johannes Vermeer of Delft\" and wrote of the \"wonderful moment\" of being \"confronted with a hitherto unknown painting by a great master\".", "Jonathan Lopez (writer) . The \"Apollo\" article summarizes the conventional account of Van Meegeren's career as follows: \"As is fairly well known, the government of the Netherlands arrested Van Meegeren as a Nazi collaborator at the end of the Second World War, charging that he had sold a priceless Vermeer to G\u00f6ring during the German occupation. When Van Meegeren revealed that he himself had painted G\u00f6ring's prized masterpiece, the news made him quite popular with the general public, and his case was thereafter handled with kid gloves. He only acknowledged forging the six biblically themed Vermeers that the government already knew to be connected to him through the strawmen who had brought the works to market; two Pieter de Hoochs sold in the same manner; and a few unfinished items that remained in his atelier. Although confidential sources informed the investigative team working on the case that Van Meegeren had sold forgeries to 'Englishmen and Americans' decades before the outbreak of hostilities, the matter seems not to have received any official attention.\"", "Forgery .

He was remanded to Weteringschans prison as an alleged Nazi collaborator and plunderer of Dutch cultural property, threatened by the authorities with the death penalty.

He exclaimed, \"The painting in G\u00f6ring\u2019s hands is not, as you assume, a Vermeer of Delft, but a Van Meegeren!

Joan Feynman (born March 31, 1927) is an American astrophysicist. She has made important contributions to the study of solar wind particles and fields; sun-Earth relations; and magnetospheric physics. In particular, Feynman is known for developing an understanding of the origin of auroras. She is also known for creating a model that predicts the number of high-energy particles likely to hit a spacecraft over its lifetime, and for uncovering a method for predicting sunspot cycles.", "Atmospheric escape . The relative importance of each loss process is a function of the planet's mass, its atmosphere composition, and its distance from its sun. One non-thermal escape mechanism is atmospheric stripping by a solar wind in the absence of a planetary magnetosphere. Excess kinetic energy from solar winds can impart sufficient energy to the atmospheric particles to allow them to reach escape velocity, causing atmospheric escape. The solar wind, composed of ions, is deflected by magnetic fields because the charged particles within the wind flow along magnetic field lines. The presence of a magnetic field thus deflects solar winds, preventing the loss of atmosphere. On Earth, for instance, the interaction between the solar wind and earth's magnetic field deflects the solar wind about the planet, with near total deflection at a distance of 10 Earth radii. This region of deflection is called a bow shock.", "Comet tail . The observation of antitails contributed significantly to the discovery of solar wind. The ion tail is the result of ultraviolet radiation ejecting electrons off particles in the coma. Once the particles have been ionised, they form a plasma which in turn induces a magnetosphere around the comet. The comet and its induced magnetic field form an obstacle to outward flowing solar wind particles. The comet is supersonic relative to the solar wind, so a bow shock is formed upstream of the comet (i.e. facing the Sun), in the flow direction of the solar wind. In this bow shock, large concentrations of cometary ions (called \"pick-up ions\") congregate and act to \"load\" the solar magnetic field with plasma. The field lines \"drape\" around the comet forming the ion tail. (This is similar to the formation of planetary magnetospheres.)", "Aurora . The Earth is constantly immersed in the solar wind, a rarefied flow of hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the Sun's outermost layer, the corona. The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400\u00a0km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm and a magnetic field intensity of around 2\u20135 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000\u201350,000 nT). During magnetic storms, in particular, flows can be several times faster; the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) may also be much stronger. Joan Feynman deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity. Her work resulted from data collected by the Explorer 33 spacecraft. The solar wind and magnetosphere consist of plasma (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It is well known (since Michael Faraday's work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts \"across\" (or is cut \"by\"), rather than \"along\", the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the \"direction\" of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. Dynamos make use of this basic process (\"the dynamo effect\"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids. The IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the sunspots, and its field lines (lines of force) are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the Parker spiral. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge (\"limb\") of the visible Sun at any time. The solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as magnetic reconnection. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the north magnetic pole and south magnetic pole.", "Saturn . Saturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple, symmetric shape \u2013 a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator \u2013 0.2\u00a0gauss (20\u00a0\u00b5T) \u2013 is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic field. As a result, Saturn's magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter's. When \"Voyager 2\" entered the magnetosphere, the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1 million km (712,000\u00a0mi), although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days. Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter \u2013 by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo. This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn's magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere. Saturn's magnetosphere, like Earth's, produces aurorae.", "Earth . The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.", "Solar wind . Where the solar wind intersects with a planet that has a well-developed magnetic field (such as Earth, Jupiter or Saturn), the particles are deflected by the Lorentz force. This region, known as the magnetosphere, causes the particles to travel around the planet rather than bombarding the atmosphere or surface. The magnetosphere is roughly shaped like a hemisphere on the side facing the Sun, then is drawn out in a long wake on the opposite side. The boundary of this region is called the magnetopause, and some of the particles are able to penetrate the magnetosphere through this region by partial reconnection of the magnetic field lines.", "Geophysics . If a planet's magnetic field is strong enough, its interaction with the solar wind forms a magnetosphere. Early space probes mapped out the gross dimensions of the Earth's magnetic field, which extends about 10 Earth radii towards the Sun. The solar wind, a stream of charged particles, streams out and around the terrestrial magnetic field, and continues behind the magnetic tail, hundreds of Earth radii downstream. Inside the magnetosphere, there are relatively dense regions of solar wind particles called the Van Allen radiation belts.", "Astronomy . A solar wind of plasma particles constantly streams outward from the Sun until, at the outermost limit of the Solar System, it reaches the heliopause. As the solar wind passes the Earth, it interacts with the Earth's magnetic field (magnetosphere) and deflects the solar wind, but traps some creating the Van Allen radiation belts that envelop the Earth . The aurora are created when solar wind particles are guided by the magnetic flux lines into the Earth's polar regions where the lines the descend into the atmosphere.", "Planetary science . If a planet's magnetic field is sufficiently strong, its interaction with the solar wind forms a magnetosphere around a planet.

Operation \"Alberich (Unternehmen Alberich\") was the code name of a German military operation in France during the First World War. It was a planned withdrawal to new positions on the shorter and more easily defended Hindenburg Line (\"Siegfriedstellung\"), which took place between 9 February and 20 March 1917. The retirement eliminated the two salients which had been formed during the Battle of the Somme in 1916, between Arras and Saint-Quentin and from Saint-Quentin to Noyon. After the war, the British named it the \"German Retreat to the Hindenburg Line\" but the operation was an calculated strategic withdrawal after months of preparation, rather than a retreat after defeat in battle. The retirement to the chord of the Bapaume and Noyon salients shortened the Western Front, providing 13\u201314 extra divisions for the German reserve being assembled to defend the Aisne front against the Nivelle Offensive being prepared by the French. Soon after taking over from Erich von Falkenhayn as Chief of the General Staff in at the end of August 1916, Paul von Hindenburg and his deputy Erich Ludendorff, the (First Quartermaster General) ordered the building of a new defensive line east of the Somme battlefront from Arras to Laon. Ludendorff was unsure as to whether retreating to the (Hindenburg Line) was desirable, since it might diminish the morale of German soldiers and civilians. An offensive was considered as an alternative if enough reserves could be assembled in the New Year and a staff study suggested that seventeen divisions might be made available but that this was far too few to have decisive effect in the west. Ludendorff accepted the plan to retire after representations by Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, commander of Army Group Rupprecht (1st, 2nd, 6th and 7th armies, from the Somme front to the North Sea coast) over the objections of the 1st and 2nd Army commanders.", "Army of the United States .

During World War I and dictated by the provisions of the National Defense Act of 1916, states contributed men to the \"Volunteer Army\" (more commonly known as the National Army). During World War I, a standard practice developed for Regular Army officers to serve in higher positions within the National Army, and thus hold two ranks - a permanent rank and a temporary rank.

Hamilton wrote that cavalry was obsolete in such a conflict, regarding their role as better accomplished by mounted infantry.

On 14 September 1918, under the command of French General Franchet d'Esperey, a combined Greek, Serbian, French and British force launched a major offensive against the Bulgarian and German army. After the first serious battle (see battle of Skra) the Bulgarian army gave up their defensive positions and began retreating towards their country. On 29 September, the armistice with Bulgaria was signed by the Allied command. The Allied army pushed north and defeated the remaining German and Austrian forces. By October 1918 the Allied armies had recaptured all of Serbia and were preparing to invade Hungary. The offensive was halted because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918, marking the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian empire.

Based on the experiences of World War II, proposals were soon made on how to more effectively manage the large combined military establishment. The Army generally favored centralization while the Navy had institutional preferences for decentralization and the status quo. The resulting National Security Act of 1947 was largely a compromise between these divergent viewpoints. The Act split the Department of War into the Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force and established the National Military Establishment (NME), presided over by the Secretary of Defense. The Act also separated the Army Air Forces from the Army to become its own branch of service, the United States Air Force. At first, each of the service secretaries maintained cabinet status. The first Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, who in his previous capacity as Secretary of the Navy had opposed creation of the new position, found it difficult to exercise authority over the other branches with the limited powers his office had at the time. To address this and other problems, the National Security Act was amended in 1949 to further consolidate the national defense structure in order to reduce interservice rivalry, directly subordinate the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to the Secretary of Defense in the chain of command, and rename the National Military Establishment as the Department of Defense, making it one Executive Department.

In 2007, he appeared in the film \"December Boys\", an Australian family drama about four orphans that was shot in 2005 and released to theatres in mid-September 2007. Also in 2007, Radcliffe co-starred with Carey Mulligan in \"My Boy Jack\", a television drama film shown on ITV on Remembrance Day. The film received mostly positive reviews, with several critics praising Radcliffe's performance as an 18-year-old who goes missing in action during a battle. Radcliffe stated, \"For many people my age, the First World War is just a topic in a history book. But I've always been fascinated by the subject and think it's as relevant today as it ever was.\"", "Politics of Harry Potter .

While developing the ideas for her book, she also decided to make Harry an orphan who attended a boarding school called Hogwarts. She explained in a 1999 interview with \"The Guardian\": \"Harry had to be an orphan\u2014so that he's a free agent, with no fear of letting down his parents, disappointing them\u00a0...

When \"Time\" magazine asked about The Harry Potter Alliance, Rowling said, \"It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting to see people going out there and doing that in the name of your character. What did my books preach against throughout? Bigotry, violence, struggles for power, no matter what. All of these things are happening in Darfur.

At the school \"he must fulfill an ancient prophecy and help overthrow a powerful, evil wizard.\" However, Yolen has stated that \"I'm pretty sure she never read my book,\" attributing similarities to commonly-used fantasy tropes. In an interview with the magazine \"Newsweek\", Yolen said, \"I always tell people that if Ms. Rowling would like to cut me a very large check, I would cash it.\" Yolen stopped reading \"Harry Potter\" after the third book, and has expressed dislike for the writing style of \"Harry Potter\", calling it \"fantasy fast food\".", "A Wizard of Earthsea . Modern writers have credited \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" for introducing the idea of a \"wizard school\", which would later be made famous by the \"Harry Potter\" series of books, and with popularizing the trope of a boy wizard, also present in \"Harry Potter\". Reviewers have also commented that the basic premise of \"A Wizard of Earthsea\", that of a talented boy going to a wizard's school and making an enemy with whom he has a close connection, is also the premise of \"Harry Potter\". Ged also receives a scar from the shadow, which hurts whenever the shadow is near him, just as Harry Potter's scar from Voldemort. Commenting on the similarity, Le Guin said that she did not feel that J. K. Rowling \"ripped her off\", but that Rowling's books received too much praise for supposed originality, and that Rowling \"could have been more gracious about her predecessors.

{"question": "The Companions were the first of what type of cavalry?", "contexts": ["Companion cavalry . The Companions (, hetairoi) were the elite cavalry of the Macedonian army from the time of king Philip II of Macedon, achieved their greatest prestige under Alexander the Great, and have been regarded as the best cavalry in the ancient world and the first shock cavalry. Chosen Companions, or Hetairoi, formed the elite guard of the king (Somatophylakes).", "Heavy cavalry . The development of the saddle as well as increasingly larger horse breeds led to creation of the Macedonian Companion cavalry, developed during the reign of Philip II of Macedon and later used with great effect by his son, Alexander the Great, in cavalry charges on enemy flanks. In both role and equipment, the Companions was the first cavalry force that was known to represent archetypal heavy cavalry. The Companion cavalry, or \"Hetairoi\", were the elite arm of the Macedonian army, and have been regarded as the best cavalry in the ancient world.", "Hellenistic armies . Thus, most cavalry types of the Hellenistic armies can be considered heavy, regardless of their armor, as long as they are equipped with lances and act in dense formations. Traditional Greek cavalry was usually employed to cover a retreat or pursue a retreating enemy. A cavalry engagement usually involved a lengthy exchange of javelins; close combat was avoided. The Macedonian Hetairoi (Companions; Companion Cavalry) may have been the first true, able shock cavalry, armed with long lances and heavy armor. Their tradition was carried on in the Hellenistic times and troops similarly armed were called doratophoroi or xystophoroi (both terms translated as lance bearers or plainly lancers). The term Hetairoi was reserved for units comprising men of aristocratic blood. These doratophoroi were primarily used against enemy cavalry; their use against densely deployed infantry was very limited. Their extreme version were the cataphracts of the Seleucid cavalry. The various Agemata (pl. of Agema), usually the elite bodyguards of the Hellenistic Kings, were similarly armed.", "Ancient Macedonian army . Although the Companion cavalry is largely regarded as the first real shock cavalry of Antiquity, it seems that Alexander was very wary of using it against well-formed infantry, as attested by Arrian in his account of the battle against the Malli, an Indian tribe he faced after Hydaspes. There, Alexander did not dare assault the dense infantry formation with his cavalry, but rather waited for his infantry to arrive, while he and his cavalry harassed their flanks. It is a common mistake to portray the Companion cavalry as a force able to burst through compact infantry lines. Alexander usually launched the Companions at the enemy after a gap had opened up between their units or disorder had already disrupted their ranks. However, the ancient historian Arrian implies that the Companion cavalry were successful in an assault, along with heavy infantry, on the Greek mercenary hoplites serving Persia in the closing stages of the Battle of Granicus. Their success may have been largely due to the poor morale of the hoplites, who had just witnessed the rest of their army broken and put to flight.", "Ancient Macedonian army . The Companion cavalry, or \"Hetairoi\" (), were the elite arm of the Macedonian army, and have been regarded as the finest quality cavalry in the ancient world. Along with Thessalian cavalry contingents, the Companions \u2014 raised from landed nobility \u2014 made up the bulk of the Macedonian heavy cavalry. Central Macedonia was good horse-rearing country and cavalry was prominent in Macedonian armies from early times. However, it was the reforms in organisation, drill and tactics introduced by Philip II that transformed the Companion cavalry into a battle-winning force, especially the introduction of, or increased emphasis on, the use of a lance and shock tactics. Coinage indicates that from an early period the primary weapons used by Macedonian cavalry were a pair of javelins. This remained true through to the reign of Archelaus I (413-399). Subsequently, despite the adoption of the lance, it is highly probable that the Companion cavalry continued to employ javelins when on scouting or skirmishing missions.", "Chor\u0105giew . In the cavalry, since the second half of the 15th century until the first half of the 18th century, a \"Chor\u0105giew\" was formed according to the \"companion system\" (system zaci\u0105gu towarzyskiego). See: \"Towarzysz\" (companion). Types of \"Chor\u0105giew\" were:", "Seleucid army . Along with the guard infantry unit, there were two guard cavalry regiments, each 1,000 strong. These were the Agema (the 'Guards') and the Hetairoi ('Companions'). The Hetairoi were recruited from the younger generation of military settlers and acted as the standing guard cavalry unit of the army, serving in peace and in war. However, it seems that writers referred to them by several names other than just the 'companions'; the basilike ile ('royal squadron' or 'regia ala' according to Livy), and the hippos hetairike ('horse companions'). Bar-Kochva presumes that from this their full title may well have been the 'royal ala of the companions'. The Agema 'consisted of Medes, selected men, with a mixture of horsemen of many races from the same part of the world. Both corps of cavalry could escort the king into battle, or both could be brigaded together into one unit of 2,000. Both units were armed with a xyston, a cavalry lance not so dissimilar to the sarissa. They were also equipped with a cuirass and helmet. After the introduction of the Cataphract, the Hetairoi were given similar but lighter protection. As for the Agema, they were probably equipped the same as the cataphracts. Another regiment of horse that was similarly armed to the cataphracts was the Nisian cavalry (Nisaioi), which was composed of Iranians.", "Companion cavalry . The Companion cavalry of the Diadochoi (Alexandrian successor-states), were even more heavily equipped. Seleucid Companions were noted to have worn lighter, but not otherwise dissimilar, equipment to the cataphracts at the Battle of Magnesia in 190 BC, which may have included partial horse armour and leg and arm protection. Ptolemaic Companions were also equipped with a large round \"aspis\" cavalry shield unlike the Companions of Phillip and Alexander.", "Battle of Gaugamela . What happened next was described by Arrian as the fiercest engagement of the battle, as Alexander and his companions encountered the cavalry of the Persian right, composed of Indians, Parthians and \"the bravest and most numerous division of the Persians\", desperately trying to get through to escape. Sixty Companions were killed in the engagement, and Hephaestion, Coenus and Menidas were all injured. Alexander prevailed, however, and Mazaeus also began to pull his forces back as Bessus had. However, unlike on the left with Bessus, the Persians soon fell into disorder as the Thessalians and other cavalry units charged forward at their fleeing enemy.", "Cataphract . There is, therefore, some doubt as to what exactly cataphracts were in late antiquity, and whether or not they were distinct from clibanarii. Some historians theorise that cataphracts and clibanarii were one and the same type of cavalry, designated differently simply as a result of their divided geographical locations and local linguistic preferences. Cataphract-like cavalry under the command of the Western Roman Empire, where Latin was the official tongue, always bore the Latinized variant of the original Greek name, \"Cataphractarii\". The cataphract-like cavalry stationed in the Eastern Roman Empire had no exclusive term ascribed to them, with both the Latin variant and the Greek innovation \"Clibanarii\" being used in historical sources, largely because of the Byzantine's heavy Greek influence (especially after the 7th century, when Latin ceased to be the official language). Contemporary sources, however, sometimes imply that clibanarii were in fact a heavier type of cavalryman, or formed special-purpose units (such as the late Equites Sagittarii Clibanarii, a Roman equivalent of horse archers, first mentioned in the \"Notitia Dignitatum\"). Therefore, either side can be argued, but given the fact that \"cataphract\" was used for more than a millennium by various cultures, it stands to reason that different types of fully armored cavalry in the armies of different nations were assigned this name by Greek and Roman scholars not familiar with the native terms for such cavalry."], "ground_truth": "Shock troops", "answer": "The first shock cavalry."}

Consequently, settlers felt that Arkansas levied and collected taxes on land that eventually might be held by Mexico. Moreover, many who resented the oppression of Texans by the Mexicans were openly declaring allegiance to the Texans. This led to general unrest, and after the Texas Republic was created, it grew worse.

{"question": "When was the first stud book created for the breed of horse that came from Rotrou introducing Arabian horses to Perche?", "contexts": ["Percheron . Arabian stallions were made available to Percheron breeders for use in breeding army mounts, beginning in 1760 at the royal stud at Le Pin. Between 1789 and the early 1800s, the Percheron was in danger of becoming extinct as horse breeding was suppressed during the French Revolution and its aftermath. Early histories of the breed point to two gray Arabian stallions from Le Pin, Godolphin and Gallipoly, as the blood that helped to restart Percheron breeding. However, later research found that Godolphin was a chestnut Arabian of ordinary conformation and no special worth, while Gallipoly was a gray saddle horse of unknown breeding. Modern breed historians contest that there was enough breeding stock left after the early 19th century to restart the breed without further Arabian influence, and state that it is unlikely that two horses of unremarkable breeding and conformation had a significant influence on the breed. Jean le Blanc, a founding stallion of the Percheron breed, was foaled in 1823. Today, all Percherons trace their ancestry to this stallion. At this time the breed also became larger, with horses from other French districts being imported to Perche to change the Percheron from a coach horse averaging to a draft horse averaging . In 1893, the first Percheron stud book was created in France. By 1910, French registrations had risen to almost 32,000 horses. Between 1880 and 1920, Percheron breeders in France exported horses all over the world, including South Africa, South America, Australia and North America.", "Percheron . The Percheron is a breed of draft horse that originated in the Huisne river valley in western France, part of the former Perche province from which the breed takes its name. Usually gray or black in color, Percherons are well muscled, and known for their intelligence and willingness to work. Although their exact origins are unknown, the ancestors of the breed were present in the valley by the 17th century. They were originally bred for use as war horses. Over time, they began to be used for pulling stagecoaches and later for agriculture and hauling heavy goods. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Arabian blood was added to the breed. Exports of Percherons from France to the United States and other countries rose exponentially in the late 19th century, and the first purely Percheron stud book was created in France in 1883.", "Homer Davenport . Upon his return to America, his newly imported horses became part of his Davenport Desert Arabian Stud in Morris Plains, New Jersey. By 1908, however, the Davenport Desert Arabian Stud was listed in the Arabian Stud Book as located in Hingham, Massachusetts, and he remained closely affiliated with Bradley's Hingham Stock Farm, which became the sole owner of the horses after Davenport's death in 1912. In 1908, Davenport became one of the five incorporators of the Arabian Horse Club of America (now the Arabian Horse Association). The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recognized the organization as the official registry for Arabian horses in 1909. Prior to that time, the Thoroughbred stud books of both the United Kingdom and the United States also handled the registration of Arabian horses. The reason a new organization, separate from the American Jockey Club, was needed to register Arabians came about largely because of Davenport. He had meticulously sought horses with pure bloodlines and known breeding strains with the expert assistance of Haffez, but once out of the desert, he was not aware that he also needed to obtain written affidavits and other paperwork to document their bloodlines. Additionally, because his Arabians were not shipped via Britain, they were not certified by the United Kingdom's Jockey Club before arriving in America, and without that authentication, the American Jockey Club refused to register his imported horses. Another factor may have influenced the organization's stance: in a cartoon, Davenport had satirized Jockey Club President August Belmont.", "Rotrou III, Count of Perche . Rotrou III (bef. 1080 \u2013 [20 January/6 May] 1144), called the Great (\"le Grand\"), was the Count of Perche and Mortagne from 1099. He was the son of Geoffrey II, Count of Perch, and Beatrix de Ramerupt, daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier. He was a notable Crusader and a participant in the \"Reconquista\" in eastern Spain, even ruling the city of Tudela in Navarre from 1123 to 1131. He is commonly credited with introducing Arabian horses to the Perche, giving rise to the Percheron breed. By his creation of a monastery at La Trappe in memory of his wife, Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England, in 1122 he also laid the foundations of the later Trappists.", "Arabian horse . Throughout the 19th century, many more Arabians came to Australia, though most were used to produce crossbred horses and left no recorded purebred descendants. The first significant imports to be permanently recorded with offspring still appearing in modern purebred Arabian pedigrees were those of James Boucaut, who in 1891 imported several Arabians from Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt's Crabbet Arabian Stud in England. Purebred Arabians were used to improve racehorses and some of them became quite famous as such; about 100 Arabian sires are included in the Australian Stud Book (for Thoroughbred racehorses). The military was also involved in the promotion of breeding calvalry horses, especially around World War I. They were part of the foundation of several breeds considered uniquely Australian, including the Australian Pony, the Waler and the Australian Stock Horse.", "Arabian horse . Other state studs included the Babolna Stud of Hungary, set up in 1789, and the Weil stud in Germany (now Weil-Marbach or the Marbach stud), founded in 1817 by King William I of W\u00fcrttemberg. King James I of England imported the first Arabian stallion, the Markham Arabian, to England in 1616. Arabians were also introduced into European race horse breeding, especially in England via the Darley Arabian, Byerly Turk, and Godolphin Arabian, the three foundation stallions of the modern Thoroughbred breed, who were each brought to England during the 18th century. Other monarchs obtained Arabian horses, often as personal mounts. One of the most famous Arabian stallions in Europe was Marengo, the war horse ridden by Napoleon Bonaparte.", "Tersk Stud . Arabians were re-introduced to the new Tersk Stud in 1925 and the first French Arabian imports arrived in 1930. These included the stallion Kann and six mares, most notable of which was Carabine. Koheilan IV was imported from Hungary. The French horses had generally good conformation but were lacking Arabian type, so the stud\u2019s managers searched for quality breeding stock with the characteristic Arabian refinement. In 1936, a shipment of 25 horses came from Crabbet Arabian Stud in England, some of which were descended from horses that had lived at the Stroganov and Shcherbatov stud and perished during the revolution. There were six stallions in the purchase, of which Naseem (a son of Skowronek and great-grandson of Mesaoud) was the most influential. Among the mares, Rissalma, Rixalina, and Star of the Hills left a significant impression on the breed.

The Percheron breed originated in the Huisne river valley in France, which arises in Orne, part of the former Perche province, from which the breed gets its name. Several theories have been put forth as to the ancestry of the breed, though its exact origins are unknown. One source of foundation bloodstock may have been mares captured by from the Bretons some time after 496 AD, and another may have been Arabian stallions brought to the area by Muslim invaders in the 8th century. Other possibilities are captured Moorish cavalry horses from the Battle of Poitiers in 732 AD, some of which were taken by warriors from Perche. A final theory posits that the Percheron and the Boulonnais breed are closely related, and that the Boulonnais influenced the Percheron when they were brought to Brittany as reinforcements for the legions of Caesar. It is known that during the 8th century, Arabian stallions were crossed with mares native to the area, and more Oriental horse blood was introduced by the Comte du Perche upon his return from the Crusades and expeditions into territory claimed by Spain. Blood from Spanish breeds was added when Rotrou III imported horses from Castile. No matter the theory of origin, breed historians agree that the terrain and climate of the Perche area had the greatest influence on the development of the breed. A possible reference to the horse is made in the 13th-century romance \"Guillaume de Dole\", in which the title character asks for \"the Count of Perche's horse\" to be made ready, possibly indicating the \"'great horse,' which could accommodate an armored knight\" and was bred in the geographical setting of the poem.", "Crossbreed . Crossbreeding in horses is often done with the intent of ultimately creating a new breed of horse. One type of modern crossbreeding in horses is used to create many of the warmblood breeds. Warmbloods are a type of horse used in the sport horse disciplines, usually registered in an open stud book by a studbook selection procedure that evaluates conformation, pedigree and, in some animals, a training or performance standard. Most warmblood breeds began as a cross of draft horse breeds on Thoroughbreds, but have, in some cases, developed over the past century to the point where they are considered to be a true-breeding population and have a closed stud book. Other types of recognized crossbreeding include that within the American Quarter Horse, which will register horses with one Thoroughbred parent and one registered Quarter Horse parent in the \"Appendix\" registry, and allow such animals full breed registration status as Quarter Horses if they meet a certain performance standard. Another well-known crossbred horse is the Anglo-Arabian, which may be produced by a purebred Arabian horse crossed on a Thoroughbred, or by various crosses of Anglo-Arabians with other Anglo-Arabians, as long as the ensuing animal never has more than 75% or less than 25% of each breed represented in its pedigree."], "ground_truth": "1883", "answer": "The first stud book was created in France in 1893 for the Percheron breed."}

{"question": "What produces the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron?", "contexts": ["Adrenal gland . The adrenal gland produces aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, which is important in the regulation of salt (\"mineral\") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.", "Aldosterone . Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon. It plays a central role in the homeostatic regulation of blood pressure, plasma sodium (Na), and potassium (K) levels. It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume. When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease. Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart.", "Nephron . The distal convoluted tubule has a different structure and function to that of the proximal convoluted tubule. Cells lining the tubule have numerous mitochondria to produce enough energy (ATP) for active transport to take place. Much of the ion transport taking place in the distal convoluted tubule is regulated by the endocrine system. In the presence of parathyroid hormone, the distal convoluted tubule reabsorbs more calcium and secretes more phosphate. When aldosterone is present, more sodium is reabsorbed and more potassium secreted. Atrial natriuretic peptide causes the distal convoluted tubule to secrete more sodium.", "WNK4 . Under basal conditions (low circulating Ang II and low Aldosterone), WNK4 will inhibit NCC function. It has been proposed that in the event of hyperkalemia and an increased secretion of aldosterone (which will upregulate both ENac and ROMK), this inhibition of NCC, will allow an increase in the arrival of sodium to the distal nephron (rich in ENaC and ROMK) which will allow the exchange of sodium for potassium ions, thereby reducing plasma potassium levels, without increasing sodium chloride retention (which is always accompanied by volume expansion). Furthermore, it has been proposed that in the presence of AngII the WNK4 mediated NCC inhibition will be suppressed thereby increasing sodium-chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. This along with the concomitant increase in passive water reabsortion due to the increased salt load in the distal convluted tubule cells will ultimately increase circulating volume.", "Feline hyperaldosteronism . Aldosterone receptors are present on the epithelial cells of the distal nephron in the kidney. Aldosterone activates sodium channels that result in sodium resorption from the urine. Increased sodium and water retention results in systemic arterial hypertension. This increase in active sodium reabsorption generates an electrochemical gradient that leads to passive transfer of potassium from the tubular cells into the urine. This causes a lower total body concentration of potassium and potentially, hypokalemia. Hypokalemia affects polarization of nerve and muscle membranes, which causes episodic muscle weakness.", "WNK4 . The WNK4 gene encodes a serine-threonine kinase expressed in distal nephron. Its primary role in renal physiology is as a molecular switch between the angiotensin II\u2013aldosterone mediated volume retention and the aldosterone mediated potassium wasting. This is achieved by regulating the sodium-chloride symporter (NCC), that is uniquely expressed in the distal nephron and is sensitive to thiazide type diuretics.", "Urinary system . Aldosterone plays a central role in regulating blood pressure through its effects on the kidney. It acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron and increases reabsorption of sodium from the glomerular filtrate. Reabsorption of sodium results in retention of water, which increases blood pressure and blood volume. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is a neurohypophysial hormone found in most mammals. Its two primary functions are to retain water in the body and vasoconstriction. Vasopressin regulates the body's retention of water by increasing water reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney nephron. Vasopressin increases water permeability of the kidney's collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule by inducing translocation of aquaporin-CD water channels in the kidney nephron collecting duct plasma membrane.", "Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion . The normal function of ADH on the kidneys is to control the amount of water reabsorbed by kidney nephrons. ADH acts in the distal portion of the renal tubule (Distal Convoluted Tubule) as well as on the collecting duct and causes the retention of water, but \"not\" solute. Hence, ADH activity effectively dilutes the blood (decreasing the concentrations of solutes such as sodium), causing hyponatremia; this is compounded by the fact that the body responds to water retention by decreasing aldosterone, thus allowing even more sodium wasting. For this reason, a high urinary sodium excretion will be seen.", "Glomerulonephritis . The nephrotic syndrome is characterised by the finding of edema in a person with increased protein in the urine and decreased protein in the blood, with increased fat in the blood. Inflammation that affects the cells surrounding the glomerulus, podocytes, increases the permeability to proteins, resulting in an increase in excreted proteins. When the amount of proteins excreted in the urine exceeds the liver's ability to compensate, fewer proteins are detected in the blood - in particular albumin, which makes up the majority of circulating proteins. With decreased proteins in the blood, there is a decrease in the oncotic pressure of the blood. This results in edema, as the oncotic pressure in tissue remains the same. Although decreased intravascular oncotic (i.e. osmotic) pressure partially explains the patient's edema, more recent studies have shown that extensive sodium retention in the distal nephron (collecting duct) is the predominant cause of water retention and edema in the nephrotic syndrome. This is worsened by the secretion of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal gland, which is secreted in response to the decrease in circulating blood and causes sodium and water retention. Hyperlipidemia is thought to be a result of the increased activity of the liver.", "Loop diuretic . Diuretic resistance is defined as failure of diuretics to reduce fluid retention (can be measured by low urinary sodium) despite using the maximal dose of drugs. There are various causes for the resistance towards loop diuretics. After initial period of diuresis, there will be a period of \"post-diuretic sodium retention\" where the rate of sodium excretion does not reach as much as the initial diuresis period. Increase intake of sodium during this period will offset the amount of excreted sodium, and thus causing diuretic resistance. Prolonged usage of loop diuretics will also contributes to resistance through \"braking phenomenon\". This is the body physiological response to reduced extracellular fluid volume, where renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system will be activated which results in nephron remodelling. Nephron remodeling increases the number of distal convoluted cells, principle cells, and intercalated cells. These cells have sodium-chloride symporter at distal convoluted tubule, epithelial sodium channels, and chloride-bicarbonate exchanger pendrin. This will promote sodium reabsorption and fluid retention, causing diuretic resistance. Other factors includes gut edema which slows down the absorption of oral loop diuretics. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) reduces renal flow rate, reducing the delivery of diuretic molecules into the nephron, limiting sodium excretion and increasing sodium retention, causing diuretic resistance. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can compete with loop diuretics for organic ion transporters, thus preventing the diuretic molecules from being secreted into the proximal convoluted tubules."], "ground_truth": "zona glomerulosa", "answer": "The adrenal gland produces the hormone aldosterone, which promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron."}

The 1994 Winter Olympics, held in Lillehammer, Norway, were the first Winter Games to be held separately from the Summer Games. This change resulted from the decision reached in the 91st IOC Session (1986) to separate the Summer and Winter Games and place them in alternating even-numbered years. Lillehammer is the northernmost city to ever host the Winter Games and it was the second time the Games were held in Norway, after the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. After the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and Slovakia made their Olympic debuts. The women's figure skating competition drew media attention when American skater Nancy Kerrigan was injured on 6 January 1994, in an assault planned by the ex-husband of opponent Tonya Harding. Both skaters competed in the Games, but the gold medal was controversially won by Oksana Baiul who became Ukraine's first Olympic champion, while Kerrigan won the silver medal. Johann Olav Koss of Norway won three gold medals, coming first in all of the distance speed skating events. 13-year-old Kim Yoon-Mi became the youngest-ever Olympic gold medallist when South Korea won the women's 3,000 meter speed skating relay. Russia won the most events, with eleven gold medals, while Norway achieved 26 podium finishes, collecting the most medals overall on home ground.

Held at Blyth Memorial Arena, the figure skating competition took place between February 19 and 26. Though this was not the first time figure skating had been held indoors, it would never be contested outdoors again. There were three events: men's and women's singles and the pairs competition. In the men's event, David Jenkins of the United States, brother of 1956 Winter Olympic figure skating champion Hayes Jenkins, won the gold medal. It was his second Olympic medal, having won the bronze in 1956. Czechoslovakian Karol Div\u00edn took the silver medal, and Canadian Donald Jackson won the bronze. American Carol Heiss, winner of the silver medal in 1956, became the Olympic champion in 1960. A year later she married Hayes Jenkins and starred in \"Snow White and the Three Stooges\". Dutch skater Sjoukje Dijkstra took the silver medal; she would finish her amateur career with an Olympic gold medal in 1964. Barbara Ann Roles gave the United States its third figure skating medal of the competition when she took the bronze. The Soviet Union made its Olympic figure skating debut by sending two couples to compete in the pairs competition; the result belied the fact that Soviet skaters would soon come to dominate this event. The competition was won by the Canadian pair of Barbara Wagner and Bob Paul who had won the last three world championships.

German luger Georg Hackl is the overall medal leader in the sport, having collected a total of five medals (three golds and two silvers) in the men's singles, during the six Winter Games in which he competed (1988\u20132006). Following his victory at the 1992 Winter Olympics, Hackl was the first male luger to successfully defend an Olympic title, in 1994. By repeating this feat in Nagano 1998, he joined two other men (Swedish figure skater Gillis Grafstr\u00f6m and German skier Ulrich Wehling) and two women (Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie and American speed skater Bonnie Blair) who had won the same individual event in three consecutive Olympic Games. Hackl was also the first-ever Olympian to win at least one medal in five consecutive Olympics.

The host nation, Austria, concluded its participation with a total of six medals (two golds, two silvers, and two bronzes). Liechtenstein won its first Olympic medals: two bronzes by Willi Frommelt and Hanni Wenzel in the alpine skiing slalom events. East German athletes achieved gold medal sweeps in luge and bobsleigh, which accounted for five of the country's seven Olympic titles. Alpine skier Rosi Mittermaier won the women's downhill and slalom events to give West Germany's two gold medals in these Games. She came close to winning a third in the giant slalom, which would have made her the first woman to win all three Olympic alpine skiing events. Cross-country skier Helena Takalo contributed three of Finland's seven medals by reaching podium place finishes in all of the women's events.

The company needed an economical way to supply the lumber camps and haul the cut timber to the saw mills located in Boyne City. In addition, the White Transportation Steamship Company wanted to compete with the steamship lines that docked at the Port of Petoskey. A railroad intersecting the Grand Rapids & Indiana Main Line at Boyne Falls with service to the Boyne City would make the commercial docks at Boyne City more competitive. A railroad control by the W.H. White Company was the solution.", "Lucin Cutoff .

The effect of rail connections was ultimately transformative; timber and other goods could be produced in the north and shipped to urban markets to the south. Diverse industries developed, such as iron works, tanneries, mills, cement plants, and agricultural enterprises. By 1885, the intense harvesting and export of pine trees led to visible decline in the lumber industry's ability to produce white pine. Logging in Michigan peaked in 1889. Where available, hardwoods and hemlock were harvested, temporarily extending the life of lumbering in the area, especially around East Jordan, the Traverse Bay, and near Crawford County. William Howard White's lumber railroad (Boyne City, Gaylord & Alpena Railroad Company), David Ward's Detroit and Charlevoix Railroad, and the East Jordan and Southern Railroad enabled access to remote timber areas. As lumbering declined, rail lines began to promote Northern Michigan as a \"fresh air\" resort destination, and the logging companies promoted their cut-over, stump-filled tracts for their agricultural potential.", "Wanamaker, Kempton and Southern Railroad .

With the decline of railroads the Reading Company filed abandonment of the Schuylkill and Lehigh line. In 1963 a group of volunteers founded the Wanamaker, Kempton & Southern Railroad with its main purpose to preserve railroad history.

However this did not happen because an uncooperative land owner forced the new railroad to stop where the owner's land started, which is why the railroad stops just a north of Wanamaker along Route 143. The new railroad purchased of track for $65,000. After the rest of the line was abandoned, the tracks south of Kempton were next on the list to be scrapped, but the WK&S had no money to purchase the line.

All \"Nepenthes\" are passive carnivores with no moving parts, unlike their distant cousins the Venus flytrap. \"Nepenthes rafflesiana\" kills by luring its prey into its pitchers, whose peristomes secrete a sweet-tasting nectar. Once the insect is inside, it quickly finds the walls of the pitcher too slippery to scale and drowns. Digestive enzymes released by the plant into the liquid break down the prey and release soluble nutrients, which are absorbed by the plant through the walls of the pitcher. The carnivorous nature of \"Nepenthes\" is supposedly a consequence of living in nutrient-poor soils; since the main method of nutrient absorption in most plants (the root) is insufficient in these soils, the plants have evolved other ways to gain nutrients. As a result, the roots of \"Nepenthes\" and most other carnivorous plants are slight and fragile; hence care must be taken when repotting.

{"question": "What was the benefit of reintroducing piston power and replacing the most popular turboprop engine in history?", "contexts": ["Six-stroke engine . This design was developed by Malcolm Beare of Australia. The technology combines a four-stroke engine bottom end with an opposed piston in the cylinder head working at half the cyclical rate of the bottom piston. Functionally, the second piston replaces the valve mechanism of a conventional engine. Claimed benefits include a 9% increase in power, and improved thermodynamic efficiency through an increased compression ratio enabled by the elimination of the hot exhaust valve.", "De Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter . Development of the aircraft began in 1964, with the first flight on May 20, 1965. A twin-engine replacement for the single-engine DHC-3 Otter retaining DHC's renowned STOL qualities, its design features included double-slotted trailing-edge flaps and ailerons that work in unison with the flaps to boost STOL performance. The availability of the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-20 turboprop in the early 1960s made the concept of a twin more feasible. To bush operators, the improved reliability of turboprop power and the improved performance of a twin-engine configuration made it an immediately popular alternative to the piston-powered Otter which had been flying since 1951.", "Grob Strato 2C . Unlike the Egrett, which was powered by a single turboprop engine, the Strato was powered by two wing-mounted pusher compound engines consisting of a turbocharged piston engine with the Gas Generator from a PW127 turboprop engine to provide a constant supply of pressurised air to the piston engine at high altitude. This had the advantage of maintaining power at high altitudes. Each engine drove a 6\u00a0m (19\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in) diameter five-bladed propeller.", "Piston ring . The split piston ring was invented by John Ramsbottom who reported the benefits to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1854. It soon replaced the hemp packing hitherto used in steam engines. The use of piston rings at once dramatically reduced the frictional resistance, the leakage of steam, and the mass of the piston, leading to significant increases in power and efficiency and longer maintenance intervals.", "Pilatus PC-6 Porter . On 4 May 1959, the first prototype, powered by a 254\u00a0kW (340 shp) piston engine, made its maiden flight. In early May 1961, the first \"Turbo Porter\", powered by a Turbomeca Astazou II turboprop engine, performed its initial flight. In comparison to its earlier piston engine-powered incarnation, the Astazou II-equipped \"Turbo Porter\" had an increased gross capacity and top speed, as well as benefitting from the engine's automatic handling functions. These benefits came at the expense of a greater initial purchase cost and higher fuel consumption. Both the piston and turbine-engine versions of the PC-6 became quickly known for their Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) capabilities, requiring only a very short takeoff run before being ready for rotation prior to taking off.", "Achates Power . The Achates Power opposed-piston engine, is modeled after the opposed-piston architecture made popular by the Junkers Jumo 205/207 aviation engines developed in the 1930s. The design positions two pistons per cylinder\u2014working in opposite, reciprocating motion. This eliminates parts including the cylinder head and valvetrain, improving overall engine efficiency as these components are considered primary contributors to heat and friction losses. The cylinder head and valvetrain systems are also among the most complex and costly elements of conventional engines. The two-stroke cycle compounds the efficiency benefits of the opposed-piston engine architecture. With this cycle, each combustion event is shorter in duration and, therefore, closer to optimum timing as compared to four-stroke engines. Two-stroke engines are also smaller in displacement and size compared to four-stroke engines for similar performance.", "Short SC.7 Skyvan . Construction started at Sydenham Airport in 1960, and the prototype first flew on 17 January 1963, powered by two Continental piston engines. Later in 1963, the prototype was re-engined with the intended Turbomeca Astazou turboprop engines. The Skyvan is an all-metal, high-wing monoplane, with a braced, high aspect ratio wing, and an unpressurised, square-section fuselage. In 1968, production switched to the Skyvan Series 3 aircraft, which replaced the Astazou engines with Garrett AiResearch TPE331 turboprops. A total of 153 Skyvans (plus the prototype) was produced before production ended in 1986.", "Swing-piston engine . Lutz's engine was being designed as an experimental gas generator for a new type of aircraft engine, one that replaced a traditional centrifugal or axial compressor with his swing-piston design. Ultimately the exhaust would be used to drive a turbine, that power being used to drive a propeller to produce a turboprop. For this role the exhaust gas was too hot to be used directly in a turbine, given the available materials, so the engine featured a second \"exhaust port\" that vented cold pressurized air, which was then mixed into the hot exhaust. For direct power use, as opposed to driving a turbine, this \"third area\" of the engine can simply be left open to the air to avoid losing power to compression that will not be used.", "Orenda OE600 . Orenda took over development of the engine in 1994. According to their engineers, the engine as it was simply wasn't capable of running at cruise power for extended periods, and required a huge amount of additional development. They completed the certification process in March 1998 as the OE600A. The OE600's \"natural\" target was the PT6, the most popular turboprop engine of all time. Although a turboprop has a superb power-to-weight ratio, it has high fuel consumption, and its performance drops off linearly with altitude. The OE600 offered better fuel economy, as well as considerably improved climb rates (even though it was heavier) and cruise speeds, all suggesting a lower overall cost of operation. On the downside, any piston engine is much more complex than a turbine, so the OE600 initially had a time between overhauls of only 1500 hours, compared to 2000-6000 for the PT6, with hot section inspections required at between 1000 and 2250 hours. Orenda expected to increase this to 2500 hours by collecting in-service reliability information.", "Hongdu N-5 . In response to demands from Chinese operators for a more powerful aircraft, studies were made of versions powered both by more powerful piston and turboprop engines, before settling on a Czech Walter M601 turboprop to produce the N-5B, this variant replacing the nosewheel undercarriage of the N-5A with a tailwheel undercarriage.

{"question": "Watercliffe Meadow Primary Schools name change is an example of what term generally used to describe the avoidance of certain language?", "contexts": ["Language planning . Frequently, acquisition planning is integrated into a larger language planning process in which the statuses of languages are evaluated, corpuses are revised and the changes are finally introduced to society on a national, state or local level through education systems, ranging from primary schools to universities. This process of change can entail a variety of modifications, such as an alteration in student textbook formatting, a change in methods of teaching an official language or the development of a bilingual language program, only to name a few. For example, if a government decides to raise the status level of a certain language or change its level of prestige, it can establish a law that requires teachers to teach only in this language or that textbooks are written using only this language's script. This, in turn, would support the elevation of the language's status or could increase its prestige. In this way, acquisition planning is often used to promote language revitalization, which can change a language's status or reverse a language shift, or to promote linguistic purism.

What is left is the writings of missionaries who visited the island to teach the word of God, and to translate the Mortlockese Language into biblical text. There are documents of what curriculum was taught in the schools opened, as well as the number of students and teachers present. There are also certain rules that are noted in several cases implying that words are not always what they seem. In terms of family and kinship, personal names were used when referring to family instead of terms like \u201ccousin,\u201d or \u201cgrandparent.\u201d Kinship terms categorize relatives instead of label them directly. This is just one example of grammar we can study from the way the Mortlockese language is designed.", "Orality . The term \u201corality\u201d has been used in a variety of ways, often to describe, in a generalised fashion, the structures of consciousness found in cultures that do not employ, or employ minimally, the technologies of writing. Walter J. Ong\u2019s work still serves as a touchstone for the study of orality, and reminds us that despite the striking success and subsequent power of written language, the vast majority of languages are never written, and the basic orality of language is permanent. In his later publications Ong distinguishes between two forms of orality: \u2018primary orality\u2019 and \u2018secondary orality\u2019. In his earlier publications Ong uses the terms 'primarily oral culture' and 'secondarily oral culture'. He works with the contrast of primary orality and secondary orality as the way to establish what one thing is by indicating what it is not: Secondary orality is not primary orality. In addition, he refers to 'oral residue' and 'residually oral cultures'. Following his example in coining the terms primary orality and secondary orality, we can refer to residual orality.", "Watercliffe Meadow Community Primary School . Watercliffe Meadow Community Primary School is a primary school in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. It is notable for changing its name from a \"school\" to \"A place of learning\" in January 2009, with staff at Watercliffe Meadow claiming that this was because, \"the word school may have negative connotations for pupils and parents.\" The change was attacked for being too politically correct.", "Historical linguistics . Studies in historical linguistics often use the terms \"conservative\" or \"innovative\" to characterize the extent of change occurring in a particular language or dialect as compared with related varieties. In particular, a \"conservative\" variety changes relatively less than an \"innovative\" variety. These variations in plasticity are often related to the socio-economic situation of the language speakers. An example of an innovative language would be the American English language because of the vast number of speakers and the open interaction these speakers have with other language groups; these changes can be seen in the terms developed for business and marketing, among other fields such as technology. The converse of the innovative language is the conservative language, and these are generally defined by their static nature and imperviousness to outside influences. Most of these languages are spoken in secluded areas that lack any other primary language speaking population, however this is not a guarantee. These descriptive terms carry no value judgment in linguistic studies, and are not used to determine any form of worthiness a language has compared to any other language.", "Geographical renaming . Geographical renaming is the changing of the name of a geographical feature or area. This can range from the uncontroversial change of a street name to a highly disputed change to the name of a country. Some names are changed locally but the new names are not recognised by other countries, especially when there is a difference in language. Other names may not be officially recognised but remain in common use. Many places have different names in different languages, and a change of language in official or general use has often resulted in what is arguably a change of name.  There are many reasons to undertake renaming, with political motivation being the primary cause; for example many places in the former Soviet Union and its satellites were renamed to honour Stalin. Sometimes a place reverts to its former name (see for example de-Stalinization). One of the most common reasons for a country changing its name is newly acquired independence. When borders are changed, sometimes due to a country splitting or two countries joining together, the names of the relevant areas can change. This, however, is more the creation of a different entity than an act of geographical renaming.", "Watercliffe Meadow Community Primary School . Watercliffe Meadow Community Primary School", "Watercliffe Meadow Community Primary School . The criticised \"change\" of name from \"school\" to \"A place for learning\" was reported with varying degrees of inaccuracy as being an early decision when the new school was formed as a merge between three former primary schools: Shirecliffe, Busk Meadow and Watermead infant and junior schools, at a cost of \u00a34.7\u00a0million. Linda Kingdon, the head teacher said: \"This is Watercliffe Meadow, a place for learning. One reason was many of the parents of the children here had very negative connotations of school. Instead, we want this to be a place for family learning, where anyone can come. We were able to start from scratch and create a new type of learning experience. There are no whistles or bells or locked doors. We wanted to deinstitutionalise the place and bring the school closer to real life.\"", "Watercliffe Meadow Community Primary School . The name on the sign was criticised, with people arguing that the change is too politically correct. Whilst this was exaggerated by dint of the fact that the tabloid media reported, inaccurately, that the word school had been banned (and in fact it merely didn't appear on the sign and continues to be used daily by staff, parents and pupils) the slogan itself opened the school up to ridicule. There was also press emphasis on the name \"change\", when in fact the subtitle to the School (Watercliffe Meadow) has been fixed since before the material completion or opening of the premises. Further to this misrepresentation, Sheffield Star contacted Marie Clair from Plain English Campaign who said: \"It's laughable. Do they think by changing the name they will change the environment? We all know what the building is. There is this whole political correctness agenda. Using unfamiliar words instead of a simple one, like 'school', will get in the way of children's ability to learn.\""], "ground_truth": "political correctness", "answer": "Geographical renaming."}

For their fifth album, \"The Joshua Tree\", the band wanted to build on \"The Unforgettable Fire\"s textures, but instead of out-of-focus experimentation, they sought a harder-hitting sound within the limitation of conventional song structures. Realising that \"U2 had no tradition\" and that their knowledge of music from before their childhood was limited, the group delved into American and Irish roots music. Friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, and Keith Richards motivated Bono to explore blues, folk, and gospel music and focused him on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. U2 halted the album sessions in June 1986 to serve as a headline act on the Conspiracy of Hope benefit concert tour for Amnesty International.

The following month, Bono travelled to Nicaragua and El Salvador and saw first-hand the distress of peasants affected by political conflicts and US military intervention.

The album juxtaposes antipathy towards US foreign policy against the group's deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom, and ideals.

Romano-British culture is the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire following the Roman conquest in AD 43 and the creation of the province of Britannia. It arose as a fusion of the imported Roman culture with that of the indigenous Britons, a people of Celtic language and custom. It survived the 5th century Roman departure from Britain. Scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries \u2013 approximately from AD 410 when the Roman legions withdrew, to AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived \u2013 southern Britain preserved an active sub-Roman culture that survived the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even used a vernacular Latin when writing.", "British Isles . Hiberni (Ireland), Pictish (northern Britain) and Britons (southern Britain) tribes, all speaking Insular Celtic, inhabited the islands at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD.

The first Anglo-Saxons arrived as Roman power waned in the 5th century and eventually dominated the bulk of what is now England. Viking invasions began in the 9th century, followed by more permanent settlements and political change\u2014particularly in England. The subsequent Norman conquest of England in 1066 and the later Angevin partial conquest of Ireland from 1169 led to the imposition of a new Norman ruling elite across much of Britain and parts of Ireland. By the Late Middle Ages, Great Britain was separated into the Kingdoms of England and Scotland, while control in Ireland fluxed between Gaelic kingdoms, Hiberno-Norman lords and the English-dominated Lordship of Ireland, soon restricted only to The Pale. The 1603 Union of the Crowns, Acts of Union 1707 and Acts of Union 1800 attempted to consolidate Britain and Ireland into a single political unit, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, with the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands remaining as Crown Dependencies. The expansion of the British Empire and migrations following the Irish Famine and Highland Clearances resulted in the distribution of the islands' population and culture throughout the world and a rapid de-population of Ireland in the second half of the 19th century.

In the years following this, Roman influence saw the importation of several religious cults into Britain, including Roman mythology, Mithraism and the imperial cult. One of these sects, then disapproved by the Roman authorities, was the Levantine-originated religion of Christianity.

In 142 AD, Roman forces pushed north again and began construction of the Antonine Wall, which ran between the Forth-Clyde isthmus, but they retreated back to Hadrian's Wall after only twenty years.

The PTRD was considered obsolete early-mid war when German medium tanks were introduced. Even when used against the early, light German tanks, the 14.5 round more often shattered upon impact rather than penetrating the armor.", "Self-propelled artillery . The Germans were particularly prolific with designs. They created many examples of lightly armored self-propelled anti-tank guns using captured French equipment (example Marder I), their own obsolete light tank chassis (Marder II), or ex-Czech chassis (Marder III). These led to better-protected tank destroyers with fully enclosed casemates, complete with full roof armor, built on medium tank chassis such as the Jagdpanzer IV and Jagdpanther. Some designs were based on existing chassis (such as the Brummb\u00e4r), leftover chassis from cancelled programs (Elefant and Sturer Emil); others were converted from battle-damaged tanks (Sturmtiger). The single most-produced armored fighting vehicle design for Germany in WW II, the Sturmgesch\u00fctz III (StuG III) assault gun, in 1936\u201337 pioneered the later casemate-style fully enclosed armor that would be used on almost all late-war German self-propelled artillery and \"Jagdpanzer\"-format tank destroyers.", "Jagdtiger . Jagdtiger (\"Hunting Tiger\") is the common name of a German turretless heavy tank destroyer of World War II. The official German designation was Panzerj\u00e4ger Tiger Ausf. B as it was based on a lengthened Tiger II chassis. The ordnance inventory designation was Sd. Kfz. 186. The 71-tonne \"Jagdtiger\" was the heaviest armored fighting vehicle used operationally during World War II and is the heaviest armored vehicle of any type to achieve series production. The vehicle carried a 128 mm PaK 44 L/55 main gun, capable of out-ranging and defeating any Allied tank. It saw service in small numbers from late 1944 to the end of the war on both the Western and Eastern Front. Although 150 were ordered, only between 70 and 88 were produced. Due to an excessive weight, the \"Jagdtiger\" was continuously plagued with mechanical problems. Today, three \"Jagdtigers\" survive in museums.", "Tanks in the German Army . After the war, many nations needed to have tanks, but only a few had the industrial resources to design and build them. During and after World War I, Britain and France were the intellectual leaders in tank design, with other countries generally following and adopting their designs. Germany was one of the countries which began to design and build their own tanks. The Treaty of Versailles had severely limited Germany's industrial output. Among the German proponents of mechanization, Gen. Heinz Guderian was probably the most influential. Guderian's 1914 service with radiotelegraphs in support of cavalry units led him to insist on a radio in every armored vehicle. By 1929, when many British students of armor were tending towards a pure armor formation, Guderian had become convinced that it was useless to develop just tanks, or even to mechanize parts of the traditional arms. What was needed was an entirely new mechanized formation of all arms that would maximize the effects of the tank. The German tanks were not up to the standards of Guderian's concept. The Mark I was really a machine gun-armed tankette, derived from the British Carden-Loyd personnel carrier. The Mark II did have a 20-mm cannon, but little armor protection. Germany, constrained by the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, was not allowed to produce tanks of any kind and only a few armoured cars. In 1926 an unofficial program of tank construction was initiaited by Von Seeckt, the commander of the Reichswehr. Built by Rheinmetall-Borsig the first grosstraktor was similar to the existing British Mk II medium tank, 20 tons with a 75\u00a0mm gun. This and other designs were tested with Soviet cooperation at a tank school in western Russia. In Germany proper dummy tanks were used in training, apparently at the instigation of then Major, Heinz Guderian, a staff tactical instructor. Guderian had read Fuller, Liddell-Hart and other tank warfare theorists and he had the support of his commanders to develop his theories into reality. In 1931 the German General Staff accepted a plan for two types of tank, a medium tank with a 75\u00a0mm gun and a lighter vehicle with a 37\u00a0mm gun. While design and then construction work was carried out the German army used a variety of light tanks based on the British Carden-Lloyd chassis. The early tanks were code-named Landwirtschaftlicher Schlepper (La S), a designation that lasted until 1938. The first of these light tanks ran in early 1934, a five-ton Krupp design it was dubbed the LKA1. The new government approved an initial order for 150 in 1934 as the 1A La S Krupp, around 1500 of these light tanks were built.", "Jagdpanther . The Jagdpanther (German: \"hunting panther\"), SdKfz 173, is a tank destroyer built by Nazi Germany during World War II based on the chassis of the Panther tank. It entered service in 1944 during the later stages of the war on the Eastern and Western Fronts. The \"Jagdpanther\" combined the 8.8 cm KwK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the armor and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of German ordnance production, maintenance and training in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage of spare parts and poor crew readiness.", "German tanks in World War II . The Panzer III was intended to be the main medium core of the German armored force when it was designed during the inter-war period. While it was originally designed to fight other tanks, its 37\u00a0mm and later 50\u00a0mm guns could not keep pace with Soviet T-34 and KV tanks, which respectively, either had sloped armor or relatively thick armor and both shared 76\u00a0mm guns. By 1941, the Panzer III was the most numerous of German tank designs, however, during the later parts of 1943, it was largely replaced by later versions of the Panzer IV and Panzer V \"Panther\". Its assault gun chassis variant, the Sturmgesch\u00fctz III was, with just over 9,400 units built, the most widely produced German armored fighting vehicle of World War II.", "Tanks in World War II . The Fiat-Ansaldo M11/39 medium tank was used from 1940 through the early period of World War II. The M11/39 was developed as a \"breakthrough tank\" (\"Carro di Rottura\"). It was replaced by the Fiat-Ansaldo M13/40 medium tank which was used in the Greek campaign and in the North African Campaign. The M13/40 was not used on the Eastern Front; Italian forces there were equipped only with Fiat L6/40s and Semovente 47/32 tank destroyers. Armament was sufficient for 1940\u201341, but did not keep up with the increased armor and firepower on Allied or German tanks and anti-tank guns; its engine was underpowered and unreliable, a condition worsened by the harsh desert climate and the initial lack of training of their crews. Beginning in 1942, the Italian Army recognized the firepower weakness of the M13/40 series and employed the Semovente 75/18 self-propelled gun alongside the tanks in their armored units, which proved capable of destroying the enemy medium tanks.", "Marder II .

There were two versions, the first mounted a modified Soviet 7.62 cm gun firing German ammunition, while the other mounted the German 7.5 cm Pak 40 gun. Its high profile and thin open-topped armor provided minimal protection to the crew.

Music for Electric Metronomes is an avant-garde aleatoric composition written in 1960 by Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi for any number of performers between three and eight. The piece involves the manipulation of electric metronomes, followed by various unspecified sounds and actions. It is a very theatrical piece, and reflects Ichiyanagi's affiliation with Fluxus, an experimental art movement from the sixties. The only true scored \"instrument\" is an electric metronome for each individual player, though the varying sounds and/or actions may involve many different instruments and objects at the discretion of the performer. Because the graphic notation of the score \u2013 a series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths \u2013 leaves room for personal interpretation and expression, each performance is unique, and almost certainly cannot be reproduced. There is no conductor for the performance. It has been recorded on the album \"Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's & 1990's\". In a review of a performance by the S.E.M. Ensemble in 1992 at the Paula Cooper Gallery, the music critic of \"The New York Times\", Alex Ross, described the piece as \"merely a timid, spastic prelude to Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's monumental \"Po\u00e8me symphonique\" for 100 metronomes\".", "Avant-garde . Avant-garde in music can refer to any form of music working within traditional structures while seeking to breach boundaries in some manner. The term is used loosely to describe the work of any musicians who radically depart from tradition altogether. By this definition, some avant-garde composers of the 20th century include Arnold Schoenberg, Charles Ives, Igor Stravinsky, Anton Webern, George Antheil (in his earliest works only), Alban Berg, Henry Cowell (in his earliest works), Philip Glass, Harry Partch, John Cage, Morton Feldman, Richard Strauss (in his earliest work), Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgard Var\u00e8se, and Iannis Xenakis.

While teaching at Queens College, Bunger became very interested in the techniques and performance of prepared piano, encountering John Cage in 1967. Evans studied Cage's early manuscripts and became expert enough that Cage asked him to edit some for publication, and to record performances of them. One such effort was a 1980 recording project at Capitol Records that eventually resulted in the Richard Bunger CD \"Four Walls\", but it was not released to the public until after 1985 when Cage allowed it to be made available; Cage had long considered these expressive pieces unrepresentative of his most influential avant garde work. Evans wrote \"The Well-Prepared Piano\" in 1973, a treatise on piano techniques for new music composition and performance with illustrations drawn by the author. Cage wrote the foreword to the book, which has been repeatedly referred to by avant-garde pianists as a \"classic\" in the field. As well in 1973, Evans performed and recorded a concert of avant garde solo piano pieces at Oberlin, including works by Cage, Henri Lazarof, Barney Childs and Charles Ives. Using manuscript fragments and notes, Evans reconstructed Cage's 1939 incidental music for Jean Cocteau's \"Marriage At The Eiffel Tower\". Evans toured extensively in the 1970s and early 1980s, exclusively performing music by 20th century American composers, from Charles Ives to Cage and beyond, always including lectures on the physical well-being of the piano in regard to challenging and potentially harmful avant garde performance techniques.", "Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York .

The inaugural festival was at Judson Hall and featured 28 composers which included John Cage and Morton Feldman.", "Avant-garde music . Although some modernist music is also avant-garde, a distinction can be made between the two categories. According to scholar Larry Sitsky, because the purpose of avant-garde music is necessarily political, social, and cultural critique, so that it challenges social and artistic values by provoking or goading audiences, composers such as Igor Stravinsky, Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, George Antheil and Claude Debussy may reasonably be considered to have been avant-gardists in their early works (which were understood as provocative, whether or not the composers intended them that way), but the label is not considered appropriate for their later music. For example, modernists of the post\u2013World War II period, such as Milton Babbitt, Luciano Berio, Elliott Carter, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, and Witold Lutos\u0142awski, never conceived their music for the purpose of goading an audience and cannot, therefore, be classified as avant-garde.

John Cage wrote this composition while he was living in Seattle, earning money by making music for dancers, such as Music for an Aquatic Ballet. Having studied for some time with Arnold Schoenberg in the past drew him closer to serial organization into his studies regarding temporal structure. In Seattle, he had the chance to experiment with the different possibilities of the prepared piano, which allowed him to create new percussive sonorities without having to use several instruments and performers. At this time, Henry Cowell, a pioneer in advanced avant-garde techniques for the piano (such as plucking the strings from the inside, using clusters, etc.), was his mentor. However, even though percussion was fairly established in the 30s (Ionisation, considered a historical breakthrough work, was composed in 1930), electric equipment used in musical performance was rare and largely unexplored.", "Works for prepared piano by John Cage .

Between the Meiji Restoration and its participation in World War I, the Empire of Japan fought in two significant wars. The first war Japan fought was the First Sino-Japanese War, fought in 1894 and 1895. The war revolved around the issue of control and influence over Korea under the rule of the Joseon dynasty. From the 1880s onward, there had been vigorous competition for influence in Korea between China and Japan. The Korean court was prone to factionalism, and was badly divided by a reformist faction that was pro-Japanese and a more conservative faction that was pro-Chinese. In 1884, a pro-Japanese coup attempt was put down by Chinese troops, and a \"residency\" under General Yuan Shikai was established in Seoul. A peasant rebellion led by the Tonghak religious movement led to a request by the Korean government for the Qing dynasty to send in troops to stabilize the country. The Empire of Japan responded by sending their own force to Korea to crush the Tonghak and installed a puppet government in Seoul. China objected and war ensued. Hostilities proved brief, with Japanese ground troops routing Chinese forces on the Liaodong Peninsula and nearly destroying the Chinese Beiyang Fleet in the Battle of the Yalu River. Japan and China signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the Liaodong Peninsula and the island of Taiwan to Japan.

In early 1896, King Gojong of Korea fled to the Russian legation in Seoul under the grounds that his life was in danger from Japanese agents, and Russian influence in Korea started to predominate.

The Japanese invasion of Taiwan () (May\u2013October 1895) was a conflict between the Empire of Japan and the armed forces of the short-lived Republic of Formosa following the Qing Dynasty's cession of Taiwan to Japan in April 1895 at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese sought to take control of their new possession, while the Republican forces fought to resist Japanese occupation. The Japanese landed near Keelung on the northern coast of Taiwan on 29 May 1895, and in a five-month campaign swept southwards to Tainan. Although their advance was slowed by guerrilla activity, the Japanese defeated the Formosan forces (a mixture of regular Chinese units and local Hakka militias) whenever they attempted to make a stand. The Japanese victory at Baguashan on 27 August, the largest battle ever fought on Taiwanese soil, doomed the Formosan resistance to an early defeat.

By the beginning of the 19th century, Dinosaur footprints were discovered near the country's east coast.

During the 1700s fossils collected from a salt lick called Big Bone Lick inspired interest in local fossils. The quality and importance of Big Bone Lick as a fossil site rivals that of the similarly aged Rancho La Brea tar pits. Fossils from Big Bone Lick would come to be studied by major figures in early America like Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin. In July 1739 a French military expedition comprising 123 French soldiers and 319 Native American warriors left Quebec under the command of Charles Le Moyne, Baron de Longueuil to help defend New Orleans from the Chickasaw, who were attacking the city on behalf of England. While on their journey down the Ohio River towards the Mississippi, they camped in what is now Kentucky. Some of the expeditions Native members formed a hunting party and embarked to acquire that evening's meal. When they returned that evening their canoes were laden with massive fossils including long tusks, massive teeth, and a thighbone almost as tall as a person. The source of their fossils was the site now known as Big Bone Lick. This find is considered the first major scientifically documented fossil discovery in American vertebrate paleontology. Near the end of 1740, Baron Charles de Longueuil departed from New Orleans to France, carrying with him fossils from Big Bone Lick. Longueuil left a large femur, three molars, and a tusk at the Cabinet du Roi. The Cabinet du Rois was a collection of curiosities stored in the chateau of the king's botanical garden. In 1756, mineralogist Jean-Etienne Guettard published a scientific paper in Paris, France with two illustrations of one of the molars Longueuil brought from Big Bone Lick to France. Although the focus of Guettard's paper was a comparison of the geology of North America with that of Switzerland, the inclusion of the illustrated molar marked the paper as the first publication to include images of an American vertebrate fossil.", "Paleontology in Kentucky . In 1767 George Crogan (an Indian agent) sent three molars, four tusks, and a vertebra to Benjamin Franklin, who was in England at the time. Benjamin Franklin wrote back to George Croghan that August about the fossils shipped from Big Bone Lick. Franklin was amazed that the tusks resembled those of an elephant, yet the molars resembled those of a carnivorous animal. Franklin also wondered at the fact that the elephant-like fossils of Big Bone Lick and Siberia were found in places so much colder than places modern elephants live. He speculated that maybe earth was in a different position in the past and its climate correspondingly different. Frontiersman Daniel Boone visited Big Bone Lick in 1770 and examined its fossils. By December, 1780 George Washington himself remarked owned a molar extracted from a large unknown animal's skull discovered at Big Bone Lick.", "Big Bone Lick State Park . Big Bone Lick State Park is located at Big Bone in Boone County, Kentucky. The name of the park comes from the Pleistocene megafauna fossils found there. Mammoths are believed to have been drawn to this location by a salt lick deposited around sulphur springs. Other animals including forms of bison, caribou, deer, elk, horse, mastodon, moose, musk ox, peccary, sloth, and possibly tapir also grazed the vegetation and salty earth around the springs that the animals relied on for their diet. The area near the springs was very soft and marshy causing many animals to become stuck with no way to escape. It bills itself as \"the birthplace of American paleontology\", a term which dates from the 1807 expedition by William Clark undertaken at the direction of President Thomas Jefferson. In Nicholas Cresswell's journal, dated 1774 to 1777, he records a visit in 1775 to what was then called \"Elephant Bone Lick.\" In this account, Cresswell describes finding several bones of \"prodigious size\", as well as tusk fragments, and teeth\u2014one weighing approximately 10 pounds.

Native Americans have been familiar with fossils for thousands of years. They both told myths about them and applied them to practical purposes. The idea of powerful natural forces contending for balance is a common motif in fossil-influenced Native American folklore. Practical applications for fossils in Native American cultures include ingestion as medicine and use in food preparation. African slaves also contributed their knowledge to the early study of paleontology in the United States. The first reasonably accurate recorded identification of vertebrate fossils in the new world was made by slaves on a South Carolina plantation who recognized the elephant affinities of mammoth molars uncovered there in 1725. However, the first major fossil discovery to attract the attention of formally trained scientists were the Ice Age fossils of Kentucky's Big Bone Lick. These fossils were studied by eminent intellectuals like France's George Cuvier and local statesmen and frontiersman like Daniel Boone, Benjamin Franklin, William Henry Harrison, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington.

Like the Cretaceous, the geologic record of Kentucky contains deposits left on both land and sea during the Tertiary. Also like the Cretaceous, Kentucky preserves plant fossils from this age. Kentucky's Tertiary flora left behind fossil fruits, cones, flower petals and stems in places like Ballard, Graves, and Fulton Counties. The Wickliffe area of Ballard County has been the source of at least 27 new plant species from that time period. The presence of termites in the state at this time is attested to by the existence of a single fossil wing preserved 2.5 miles south of Columbus. The Tertiary marine life of Kentucky included marine mollusks. Fish were also present and sometimes their scales would fossilize.Pliocene to Pleistocene invertebrate fossils are common in Fayette County. Glaciers intruded into the northernmost part of the state. The vertebrates from this interval of time outside of Big Bone Lick include giant beavers in eastern Kentucky and tapirs in Fayette County. Other local wildlife included short-faced bear, bison, elk, lions, mammoths, mastodons, and giant ground sloths. Fossils from animals like these are widespread throughout the state and preserved in a variety of contexts. Among the types of deposits preserving mammals of this age are caves, ponds, river gravel, salt licks, sinkholes, and mineral springs.", "Paleontology in Kentucky . Paleontology in Kentucky refers to paleontological research occurring within or conducted by people from the U.S. state of Kentucky. Kentucky's abundance of exposed sedimentary rock makes it an ideal source of fossils. The oldest exposed rocks in Kentucky are of Ordovician age. The geologic column of Kentucky also contains rocks deposited during the ensuing periods until the end of the Pennsylvanian. During this span of time the state was first home to a warm shallow sea home to an abundance and variety of brachiopods, cephalopods, crinoids, and trilobites. During the Devonian, a large reef system formed at what is now the Falls of the Ohio. Swamps covered Kentucky during the ensuing Carboniferous period. Then a gap spans from the start of the Permian to the Pleistocene, although the gap is interrupted by minor deposits of Cretaceous and Eocene rocks. These deposits mainly preserve plant fossils. Ice Age Kentucky was home to short-faced bear, bison, elk, lions, mammoths, mastodons, and giant ground sloths. Local Native Americans interpreted fossils of this age at Big Bone Lick as belonging to ancient monsters killed by benevolent mystical little people.

{"question": "The Northern Circuit dates from a year when a King of England married to whom sent his justices on circuit?", "contexts": ["Northern Circuit . The Northern Circuit dates from 1176 when Henry II sent his judges on circuit to do justice in his name. The Circuit encompassed the whole of the North of England but in 1876 it was divided. That part to the west of the Pennines retained the old name. The land to the east became the territory of the newly formed North Eastern Circuit. The two circuits have maintained strong links.", "Gun Court . The Gun Court has three divisions: the Resident Magistrate's Division, the High Court Division, and the Circuit Court Division. The three divisions differ in their jurisdictions and procedures. When someone is charged with a firearm violation, whether by unlicensed possession alone or by use of a gun in commission of a crime, the case is ordinarily sent to the High Court Division. These cases are tried \"in camera\" by a justice of the Supreme Court of Jamaica, without a jury. The exceptions are charges of murder and treason. As capital offences, these require a jury trial. Charges of murder or treason using firearms are given preliminary investigation by a single resident magistrate in the Resident Magistrate's Division of the Gun Court, \"in camera\". They are then sent to the Gun Court's Circuit Court Division. A Supreme Court justice presides over a jury trial, \"exercising the jurisdiction of a Circuit Court.\" The Circuit Court Division therefore differs from the other divisions of the Gun Court in practicing jury trial.", "John Spelman (judge) . His Spelman ancestors originated in Hampshire, where before 1272 they held the manor of Brockenhurst, but by 1369 had moved to Norfolk where they had lands in and later acquired the manor of Bekerton. About 1500, he followed his father to study law at Gray's Inn, where he served as Reader three times, and in 1521 was created a serjeant, followed next year by gaining his father's old post of Recorder of Norwich. In 1526 he was promoted to King's Serjeant and in 1531 was appointed a Justice of the King's Bench, being sworn in by the Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas More. Knighted in 1532, he went as a justice of assize on the Northern Circuit, changing to the Home Circuit in 1537. From 1540 he stopped going on circuit and sat at Westminster Hall.", "Ranulf de Glanvill . He was born 1112 at Stratford St Andrew near Saxmundham in Suffolk, but there is little information about his early life. He is first heard of as Sheriff of Yorkshire, Warwickshire and Leicestershire from 1163 to 1170 when, along with the majority of High Sheriffs, he was removed from office for corruption. However, in 1173 he had been appointed Sheriff of Lancashire and custodian of the honour of Richmond. In 1174, when he was Sheriff of Westmorland, he was one of the English leaders at the Battle of Alnwick, and it was to him that the king of Scotland, William the Lion, surrendered. In 1175 he was reappointed Sheriff of Yorkshire, in 1176 he became justice of the king's court and a justice itinerant in the northern circuit, and in 1180 Chief Justiciar of England. It was with his assistance that Henry II completed his famous judicial reforms, though many had been carried out before he came into office. He became the king's right-hand man, and during Henry's frequent absences was in effect regent of England. In 1176 he was also made custodian of Queen Eleanor, who was confined to her quarters in Winchester Castle.", "Grand jury . The first instance of a grand jury can be traced back to the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, an Act of Henry II of England. Henry's chief impact on the development of the English monarchy was to increase the jurisdiction of the royal courts at the expense of the feudal courts. Itinerant justices on regular circuits were sent out once each year to enforce the \"King's Peace\". To make this system of royal criminal justice more effective, Henry employed the method of inquest used by William the Conqueror in the Domesday Book. In each shire, a body of important men was sworn (\"jur\u00e9\") to report to the sheriff all crimes committed since the last session of the circuit court. Thus originated the more recent grand jury that presents information for an indictment. The grand jury was later recognized by King John in Magna Carta in 1215 on demand of the nobility.", "Martin of Littlebury . In the late 1240s Martin served as an occasional Assize Justice, but did not begin full service as a royal justice until the 1260s. In the first half of 1261 he served as a junior justice on three Eyres led by Gilbert of Preston, and became a senior justice on his own Eyre circuit when Eyres resumed in 1262. His final Eyre was in 1263 in Lincolnshire, although the circuit was never completed due to the outbreak of the Second Barons' War. He did not serve during the 1264 reign of Simon de Montford, the \"uncrowned King of England\", and was not returned to the bench until 1267, when he was appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. According to official record he was a voice of moderation after the defeat of de Montford at the 1265 Battle of Evesham, calling for provisions to be made for the widows of those who had died and for the wives of noblemen who had survived but been disinherited.", "William Bendings . In 1178 Bendings was a royal justice in Yorkshire. In 1179, on the resignation of the chief justice, Richard de Lucy, a redistribution of the circuits was carried into effect. In place of the six circuits then existing the country was divided into four, to each of which, except the northern circuit, five judges were assigned, three or four of the number being laymen. To the northern circuit six judges were assigned, of whom Bendings was one, having for one of his colleagues the celebrated Ranulf Glanvill, who was made chief justice the following year. Bendings is named as a royal justice in a November 1179 fine made at Westminster. In 1183-4 we find him acting as sheriff of Dorset and Somerset, the two counties being united under his single jurisdiction. There seems to be no reason to suppose, with Edward Foss, that the expression, 'sex justiti\u00e6 in curia regis constituti ad audiendum clamores populi', applied to the six judges of the northern circuit, imports any jurisdiction peculiar to them.", "Henry of Bath . In 1241 he went on a mission to Ireland, and on his return served for two terms as a justice \"Coram Rege\" (in the presence of the King) until 1242. After Henry III left for his trip to Gascony in 1242 he was made High Sheriff of Yorkshire, a position he held until 1248 (although it was administrated by his deputies from 1245 onwards). In 1245 he became Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas. From 1247 to 1249 he acted as the senior justice for an Eyre circuit, during which period the Court of Common Pleas did not sit. In 1249 he was again promoted, leaving his position of Chief Justice, and received a salary of over \u00a3100 a year. Between 1250 and 1251 he was senior justice for another Eyre circuit, at which point he was accused of deliberately perverting the course of justice, for which his judicial position was taken, he was stripped of his position as Keeper of Gloucester Castle and he was fined 2000 marks, part of which was still unpaid when he died.", "Ralph de Hengham .

Recently Wally Pfister, cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's three Batman films made his directorial debut with \"Transcendence\".

This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, and reading scripts. Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities. Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production. A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying. Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment. The National Film School of Denmark has the student's final projects presented on national TV. Some film schools retain the rights for their students' works.

Beginning with \"Duelle\", Rivette worked with Lubtchansky's husband William, as cinematographer on nearly all his films. Rivette and William Lubtchansky did not plan the film's look in advance, collaborating on set after Rivette had rehearsed with the actors. According to Dave Kehr, \"With Mr. Lubtchansky present, he would run through the scene several times, and then consult with his cinematographer to choose the camera angles and lighting schemes he believed most appropriate to the material\". Lubtchansky's cinematography varied in the films, and Rivette never developed the signature visual style of other directors. Kehr described Lubtchansky's work in \"Le Pont du Nord\" as \"fluid, sunny images\" and \"The Duchess of Langeais\" as having a \"dark, heavy, almost Germanic manner\". Ronald Bergan praised Lubtchansky's cinematography on \"Duelle\" and \"Noro\u00eet\" for its \"fluid camerawork, superb long takes and an atmospheric use of understated blues and reds\", and said that Lubtchansky was \"attuned to the director's sudden, intuitive changes and improvisations\".

By the late 1990s, electronic influences became evident in dance-pop music; Madonna's critically acclaimed and commercially successful album \"Ray of Light\" (1998) incorporated techno, trance and other forms of electronic dance music, bringing electronica into mainstream dance-pop. Additionally, also in 1998, Cher released a dance-pop song called \"Believe\" which made usage of a technological innovation of the time, Auto-Tune.

Musically, the album contains a variety of genres including hard rock, ballad, and electronic dance music, as described by Patrick St. Michel at \"The Japan Times\" and Hamasaki. The album consists of nine original new tracks, with one of them being an opening instrumental track, and one cover; the cover is \"Many Classic Moments\", which was originally recorded by Japanese group Globe and appeared on their tribute album, \"#Globe20th\" in 2015. St. Michel stated that \"Made in Japan\" \"finds Hamasaki jumping between sounds, hop-scotching from driving rock numbers featuring arena-ready guitar solos to surging ballads... all familiar ground to her.\"", "Music of Italy . Italy has been an important country with regards to electronic dance music, especially ever since the creation of Italo disco in the late 1970s to early 1980s. The genre, originating from disco, blended \"melancholy melodies\" with pop and electronic music, making usage of synthesizers and drum machines, which often gave it a futuristic sound. According to an article in \"The Guardian\", in cities such as Verona and Milan, producers would work with singers, using mass-made synthesizers and drum machines, and incorporating them into a mix of experimental music with a \"classic-pop sensibility\" which would be aimed for nightclubs. The songs produced would often be sold later by labels and companies such as the Milan-based Discomagic. Italo disco influenced several electronic groups, such as the Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and New Order, as well as genres such as Eurodance, Eurobeat and freestyle. By circa 1988, however, the genre had merged into other forms of European dance and electronic music, one of which was Italo house. Italo house blended elements of Italo disco with traditional house music; its sound was generally uplifting, and made strong usage of piano melodies. By the latter half of the 1990s, a subgenre of Eurodance known as Italo dance emerged. Taking influences from Italo disco and Italo house, Italo dance generally included synthesizer riffs, a melodic sound, and the usage of vocoders. Over the years, there have been several important Italian dance music composers and producers, such as Giorgio Moroder, who won three Academy Awards for his music.

The scorpion's exoskeleton is thick and durable, providing good protection from predators. Scorpions have two eyes on the top of the cephalothorax, and usually two to five pairs of eyes along the front corners of the cephalothorax. While unable to form sharp images, their central eyes are amongst the most light sensitive in the animal kingdom, especially in dim light, and makes it possible for nocturnal species to use star light to navigate at night. Some species also have light receptions in their tail.

There are many quadrupedal gaits. The most diverse group of animals on earth, the insects, are included in a larger taxon known as hexapods, most of which are hexapedal, walking and standing on six legs. Exceptions among the insects include praying mantises and water scorpions, which are quadrupeds with their front two legs modified for grasping, some butterflies such as the Lycaenidae (blues and hairstreaks) which use only four legs, and some kinds of insect larvae that may have no legs (e.g., maggots), or additional prolegs (e.g., caterpillars).", "Solifugae . Solifugae is an order of animals in the class Arachnida known variously as camel spiders, wind scorpions, sun spiders, or solifuges. The order includes more than 1,000 described species in about 153 genera. Despite the common names, they are neither true scorpions (order Scorpiones) nor true spiders (order Araneae). Much like a spider, the body of a solifugid has two tagmata: an opisthosoma (abdomen) behind the prosoma (that is, in effect, a combined head and thorax). At the front end, the prosoma bears two chelicerae that, in most species, are conspicuously large. The chelicerae serve as jaws and in many species also are used for stridulation. Unlike scorpions, solifugids do not have a third tagma that forms a \"tail\". Most species of Solifugae live in dry climates and feed opportunistically on ground-dwelling arthropods and other small animals. The largest species grow to a length of , including legs.

They found that proposed top speeds in excess of were infeasible, because they would require very large leg muscles (more than approximately 40\u201386%\u00a0of total body mass). Even moderately fast speeds would have required large leg muscles. This discussion is difficult to resolve, as it is unknown how large the leg muscles actually were in \"Tyrannosaurus\". If they were smaller, only walking or jogging might have been possible.", "Chelicerata . However, the structure of \"family tree\" relationships within the Chelicerata has been controversial ever since the late 19th century. An attempt in 2002 to combine analysis of RNA features of modern chelicerates and anatomical features of modern and fossil ones produced credible results for many lower-level groups, but its results for the high-level relationships between major sub-groups of chelicerates were unstable, in other words minor changes in the inputs caused significant changes in the outputs of the computer program used (POY). An analysis in 2007 using only anatomical features produced the cladogram on the right, but also noted that many uncertainties remain. The position of scorpions is particularly controversial. Some early fossils such as the Late Silurian \"Proscorpius\" have been classified by paleontologists as scorpions, but described as wholly aquatic as they had gills rather than book lungs or tracheae. Their mouths are also completely under their heads and almost between the first pair of legs, as in the extinct eurypterids and living horseshoe crabs. This presents a difficult choice: classify \"Proscorpius\" and other aquatic fossils as something other than scorpions, despite the similarities; accept that \"scorpions\" are not monophyletic but consist of separate aquatic and terrestrial groups; or treat scorpions as more closely related to eurypterids and possibly horseshoe crabs than to spiders and other arachnids, so that either scorpions are not arachnids or \"arachnids\" are not monophyletic. Cladistic analyses have recovered \"Proscorpius\" within the scorpions, based on reinterpretation of the species' breathing apparatus. This is reflected also in the reinterpretation of \"Palaeoscorpius\" as a terrestrial animal. Although well behind the insects, chelicerates are one of the most diverse groups of animals, with over 77,000 living species that have been described in scientific publications. Some estimates suggest that there may be 130,000 undescribed species of spider and nearly 500,000 undescribed species of mites and ticks. While the earliest chelicerates and the living Pycnogonida (if they are chelicerates) and Xiphosura are marine animals that breathe dissolved oxygen, the vast majority of living species are air-breathers, although a few spider species build \"diving bell\" webs that enable them to live under water.

The young generally resemble their parents. Growth is accomplished by periodic shedding of the exoskeleton (ecdysis). A scorpion's developmental progress is measured in instars (how many moults it has undergone). Scorpions typically require between five and seven moults to reach maturity. Moulting commences with a split in the old exoskeleton just below the edge of the carapace (at the front of the prosoma). The scorpion then emerges from this split; the pedipalps and legs are first removed from the old exoskeleton, followed eventually by the metasoma. When it emerges, the scorpion's new exoskeleton is soft, making the scorpion highly vulnerable to attack. The scorpion must constantly stretch while the new exoskeleton hardens to ensure that it can move when the hardening is complete. The process of hardening is called sclerotisation. The new exoskeleton does not fluoresce; as sclerotisation occurs, the fluorescence gradually returns.", "Hartmut Winkler .

The vocal range of the tenor is one of the highest of the male voice types. Within opera, the lowest note in the standard tenor repertoire is F# in Arthur Sullivan's sparsely performed Cox and Box in a cadenza written for the role of James John Box (it should be noted, however, that because of the extremity of this note in a tenor range, many performers will take that part of the cadenza up an octave). Within more frequently performed repertoire, Mime and Herod both call for an A. A few tenor roles in the standard repertoire call for a \"tenor C\" (C, one octave above middle C). Some, if not all, of the few top Cs in the standard operatic repertoire are either optional\u2014such as in \"Che gelida manina\" in Puccini's \"La boh\u00e8me\"\u2014or interpolated (added) by tradition, such as in \"Di quella pira\" from Verdi's \"Il trovatore\"); however, the highest demanded note in the standard tenor operatic repertoire is D, found in \"Mes amis, \u00e9coutez l'histoire\" from Adolph Adams' \"Le postillon de Lonjumeau\" and \"\" from Fromental Hal\u00e9vy's \"La Juive\"). Some operatic roles for tenors require a darker timbre and fewer high notes. In the \"leggero\" repertoire, the highest note is F (Arturo in \"Credeasi, misera\" from Bellini's \"I puritani\"), therefore, very few tenors have this role in their repertoire without transposition (given the raising of concert pitch since its composition).", "Charles Craig (tenor) .

Galli-Curci and Caruso also acted as godparents for the son of the Sicilian tenor Giulio Crimi.", "Operatic pop . In 1986, operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti had a hit with the Lucio Dalla song \"Caruso\", which helped to spark a recent flourishing of operatic pop. Other singers, including Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban, and Katherine Jenkins, also recorded the number. Bocelli, in particular, soon became a leading representative of the subgenre. In the 2000s, singers and singing groups devoted primarily to operatic pop built on this renewed success. Groups like Il Divo and Amici Forever have achieved popularity with the mix of \"contemporary pop with operatic style\" characteristic of operatic pop. The subgenre is often performed by classical crossover singers and acts, although that field is much broader in the types of music it encompasses. \"Popera\" performances, such as those by the Three Tenors, have reached larger audiences and brought in greater profits than typical for operatic music.", "Gerald English .

In the ancient Punjab region, people wore cotton clothing. The tops for both genders reached to the knees. A scarf was worn over the tops which would be draped over the left shoulder and under the right. A large sheet would be further draped over one shoulder which would hang loose towards the knees. Both sexes wore a dhoti around the waist. Modern Punjabi dress has retained this outfit but over its long history has added other forms of dress.", "Sari . Nivi drape starts with one end of the sari tucked into the waistband of the petticoat, usually a plain skirt. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body once, then hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are tucked into the waistband of the petticoat. They create a graceful, decorative effect which poets have likened to the petals of a flower. After one more turn around the waist, the loose end is draped over the shoulder. The loose end is called the \"pallu\", \"pallav\", \"seragu\", or \"paita\" depending on the language. It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right hip to over the left shoulder, partly baring the midriff. The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the \"pallu\", depending on the social setting. The long end of the \"pallu\" hanging from the back of the shoulder is often intricately decorated. The \"pallu\" may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well.

J. B. S. Haldane, when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied \"fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era.\" Numerous other potential ways to falsify evolution have also been proposed. For example, the fact that humans have one fewer pair of chromosomes than the great apes offered a testable hypothesis involving the fusion or splitting of chromosomes from a common ancestor. The fusion hypothesis was confirmed in 2005 by discovery that human chromosome 2 is homologous with a fusion of two chromosomes that remain separate in other primates. Extra, inactive telomeres and centromeres remain on human chromosome 2 as a result of the fusion. The assertion of common descent could also have been disproven with the invention of DNA sequencing methods. If true, human DNA should be far more similar to chimpanzees and other great apes, than to other mammals. If not, then common descent is falsified. DNA analysis has shown that humans and chimpanzees share a large percentage of their DNA (between 95% to 99.4% depending on the measure).

The mosque is named after Ertu\u011frul Gazi, the father of the founder of the Ottoman Empire, Osman I, as a commendation to him. The name also comes from the Ertu\u011frul regiment, a royal palace guard regiment which comprises Turks from the Domani\u00e7 region. Initially the complex only consisted of the mosque, tekke, and the guesthouse. After the death of Sheikh Hamza Zafir in 1903, his t\u00fcrbe was constructed next to the mosque by the Italian architect Raimondo D'Aronco between 1905 and 1906. The library and the fountain were also added in this expansion. After the passing of Sheikh Hamza Zafir, his two brothers Muhammed Zafir Efendi and Be\u015fir Zafir Efendi became the sheikhs of the tekke. They are also buried in the t\u00fcrbe next to their elder brother.  The complex is mainly built as a guesthouse to various sheikhs and Islamic scholars that visit Istanbul from the Islamic world in an effort to strengthen the power of the position of the Caliphate in the Islamic world. After the abolition of tekkes in 1925, the mosque and tekke were closed and the two guesthouse buildings are used as a primary school, \u015eair Nedim Primary School. Due to extensive wear over the years, all the buildings are closed in 1960. The mosque has been restored between 1969 and 1973 by the General Directorate for Foundations of the Republic of Turkey and it is opened to public in 1973. Recently, all the buildings except the guesthouses have undergone through another restoration process. The restoration is started in 2008 and lasted for two years.

The psilocybin molecule is indirectly responsible for the hallucinogenic properties of the \"Psilocybe\". This compound, as well as all other indole alkaloids, are derived from the amino acid tryptophan, being the only amino acid with the indole-amine ring. Tryptophan is converted to tryptamine by decarboxylation. Two methylation steps occur producing DMT, another psychedelic compound. Hydroxylation of this compound produces the more potent hallucinogen psilocin, followed by phosphorylation yielding psilocybin. After ingestion of the psilocybin compound alkaline phosphatases present in the body's digestive system, kidneys, and possibly in the blood readily cleave the phosphoryl ester bond from psilocybin, yielding the hydroxyl compound, psilocin. Psilocin is the chemical primarily responsible for the hallucinogenic effects of the \"Psilocybe\". The blue-staining species of \"Psilocybe\" are characterized by the presence of psilocin and psilocybin. This blue-staining reaction occurs after the fruit body has been injured, particularly near the base of the stalk. This reaction is thought to be due to the oxidation of psilocybin after the outer surface of the fruit body has been breached.

{"question": "What is one risk to Norway's financial reserve?", "contexts": ["Liquidity risk . Alan Greenspan (1999) discusses management of foreign exchange reserves and suggested a measure called Liquidity at risk. A country's liquidity position under a range of possible outcomes for relevant financial variables (exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads, etc.) is considered. It might be possible to express a standard in terms of the probabilities of different outcomes. For example, an acceptable debt structure could have an average maturity\u2014averaged over estimated distributions for relevant financial variables\u2014in excess of a certain limit. In addition, countries could be expected to hold sufficient liquid reserves to ensure that they could avoid new borrowing for one year with a certain ex ante probability, such as 95 percent of the time.", "Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses . In banking, the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL), formerly known as the reserve for bad debts, is a calculated reserve that financial institutions establish in relation to the estimated credit risk within the institution\u2019s assets. This credit risk represents the charge-offs that will most likely be realized against an institution\u2019s operating income as of the financial statement end date. This reserve reduces the book value of the institution\u2019s loans and leases to the amount that the institution reasonably expects to collect.", "Money . Commercial bank money is created through fractional-reserve banking, the banking practice where banks keep only a \"fraction\" of their deposits in reserve (as cash and other highly liquid assets) and lend out the remainder, while maintaining the simultaneous obligation to redeem all these deposits upon demand. Commercial bank money differs from commodity and fiat money in two ways: firstly it is non-physical, as its existence is only reflected in the account ledgers of banks and other financial institutions, and secondly, there is some element of risk that the claim will not be fulfilled if the financial institution becomes insolvent. The process of fractional-reserve banking has a cumulative effect of money creation by commercial banks, as it expands money supply (cash and demand deposits) beyond what it would otherwise be. Because of the prevalence of fractional reserve banking, the broad money supply of most countries is a multiple larger than the amount of base money created by the country's central bank. That multiple (called the money multiplier) is determined by the reserve requirement or other financial ratio requirements imposed by financial regulators.", "Risk measure . In financial mathematics, a risk measure is used to determine the amount of an asset or set of assets (traditionally currency) to be kept in reserve. The purpose of this reserve is to make the risks taken by financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies, acceptable to the regulator. In recent years attention has turned towards convex and coherent risk measurement.", "Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 .

In 2005, at a celebration honouring Alan Greenspan, who was about to retire as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector. In that paper, Rajan \"argued that disaster might loom.\" Rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to \"take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but, in return, offer generous compensation the rest of the time. These risks are known as tail risks. But perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialise, financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimised.\"", "Credit derivative . Risks involving credit derivatives are a concern among regulators of financial markets. The US Federal Reserve issued several statements in the Fall of 2005 about these risks, and highlighted the growing backlog of confirmations for credit derivatives trades. These backlogs pose risks to the market (both in theory and in all likelihood), and they exacerbate other risks in the financial system. One challenge in regulating these and other derivatives is that the people who know most about them also typically have a vested incentive in encouraging their growth and lack of regulation. Incentive may be indirect, e.g., academics have not only consulting incentives, but also incentives in keeping open doors for research.", "Reservation poverty .

In comparison, chemists who have obtained a Master of Science (M.S.) in chemistry or in a very related discipline may find chemist roles that allow them to enjoy more independence, leadership and responsibility earlier in their careers with less years of experience than those with a bachelor's degree as highest degree. Sometimes, M.S. chemists receive more complex tasks duties in comparison with the roles and positions found by chemists with a bachelor's degree as their highest academic degree and with the same or close-to-same years of job experience. There are positions that are open only to those that at least have a degree related to chemistry at the master's level. Although good chemists without a Ph. D. degree but with relatively many years of experience may be allowed some applied research positions, the general rule is that Ph. D. chemists are preferred for research positions and are typically the preferred choice for the highest administrative positions on big enterprises involved in chemistry-related duties. Some positions, especially research oriented, will only allow those chemists who are Ph. D. holders.

However, Keefe was disappointed in the album, for it did not showcase significant refinements as she did on \"Taylor Swift\"; but, with an immature voice and young age, to him, Swift still had enough time to perfect her craft and make a great album.

In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers.

Rose thought that the sessions were \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks\".

I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through\". Swift was at an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005 when she caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, Big Machine Records.

The singer began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after signing the record deal. She persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right \"chemistry\".

Small clubs, bars and coffeehouses use a fairly simple set-up, with front of house speaker cabinets (and subwoofers, in some cases) aimed at the audience, and monitor speaker cabinets aimed back at the performers so they can hear their vocals and instruments. In many cases, front of house speakers are elevated, either by mounting them on poles or by \"flying\" them from anchors in the ceiling. The Front of House speakers are elevated to prevent the sound from being absorbed by the first few rows of audience members. The subwoofers do not need to be elevated, because deep bass is omnidirectional. In the smallest coffeehouses and bars, the audio mixer may be onstage so that the performers can mix their own sound levels. In larger bars, the audio mixer may be located in or behind the audience seating area, so that an audio engineer can listen to the mix and adjust the sound levels. The adjustments to the monitor speaker mix may be made by a single audio engineer using the main mixing board, or they may be made by a second audio engineer who uses a separate mixing board. For popular music concerts, a more powerful and more complicated PA System is used to provide live sound reproduction. In a concert setting, there are typically two complete PA systems: the \"main\" system and the \"monitor\" system. Each system consists of a mixing board, sound processing equipment, amplifiers, and speakers. The microphones that are used to pick up vocals and amplifier sounds are routed through both the main and monitor systems.

Stewart said the only thing that had changed since then were the trees growing bigger. As requested, those near the track were cut and replaced with a small run-off area, and armco.

It is common to consider any tragedy containing an element of revenge a revenge tragedy. Lily Campbell argues that revenge is the great thematic uniter of all early modern tragedy, and \"all Elizabethan tragedy must appear as fundamentally a tragedy of revenge if the extent of the idea of revenge be but grasped.\" Fredson Bowers's work (1959) on the genre not only widened and complicated what revenge tragedy is, but also increased its function as a productive lens in the work of dramatic interpretation. A revenge tragedy can also be any tragedy where revenge is, more or less, a minor part of the overall narrative, rather than a narrative's major driving force. As long as revenge is an underlying theme or motivation throughout the piece, it can be labeled as a revenge tragedy. For example, John Webster's \"The Duchess of Malfi\" (c.1613), while often classified as a tragedy (originally was marketed as \"The Tragedy of the Dutchesse of Malfy\"), can also be classified or read as a revenge tragedy, since both major and minor characters are motivated by revenge. Likewise, \"Titus Andronicus\" was originally marketed in the First Folio as \"The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus.\" \"Hamlet\" was similarly titled in the First Folio as \"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\" and \"The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\" in the Second Quarto edition (1604).

This leads him to kill everybody that he faced in his search to satisfy himself and avenge them.

Some bois are trans and/or intersex people. Some \"bois\" identify as one or more of these, but they almost always identify as lesbians, dykes, or queer. Many trans bois are also genderqueer/nonbinary (in itself a trans/transgender group), or might identify as cis persons or trans men, and yet practice genderfuck in which they do not fit in either masculine or feminine binary gender presentation. Bois may prefer a range of pronouns, including \"he\", \"she\", or non-binary and gender-neutral pronouns such as \"they\", \"co\", \"hir\", \"sie\", \"zie\", \"xe\", and \"ey\".", "Transgender . Genderqueer or non-binary identities, which are not exclusively masculine or feminine but instead are agender, androgynous, bigender, pangender, or genderfluid, exist outside of cisnormativity. Bigender and androgynous are overlapping categories; bigender individuals may identify as moving between male and female roles (genderfluid) or as being both male and female simultaneously (androgynous), and androgynes may similarly identify as beyond gender or genderless (postgender, agender), between genders (intergender), moving across genders (genderfluid), or simultaneously exhibiting multiple genders (pangender). Limited forms of androgyny are common (women wearing pants, men wearing earrings) and are not seen as transgender behavior. \"Androgyne\" is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an intersex person. Genderqueer identities are independent of sexual orientation.", "Transfeminism . Despite the similarities, there are also differences between transfeminism and many other forms of feminism. For example, transfeminism stands in stark contrast to mainstream second-wave feminism. Transfeminists often criticize the ideas of a universal sisterhood, aligning more with intersectionality and with the mainstream third wave's appreciation for the diversity of women's experience. Citing their common experience, many transfeminists directly challenge the idea that femininity is an entirely social construction. Instead, they view gender as a multifaceted set of diverse intrinsic and social qualities. For example, there are trans/cis men/women who express themselves in an unusually feminine or masculine way. Because this strongly affects how the person experiences and articulates their gender, and also their standing within patriarchy, these transfeminists would argue that masculine/feminine expression is an important concept worthy of feminist inquiry, to be compared and contrasted with both assigned sex and gender identity.", "Androgyny . An androgyne is a person who does not fit neatly into the typical masculine and feminine gender roles of their society.

They may identify as \"non-gender\", \"gender-neutral\", \"agender\", \"between genders\", \"genderqueer\", \"non-binary\", \"multigender\", \"intergendered\", \"pangender\" or \"gender fluid\". A person who is androgynous may engage freely in what is seen as masculine or feminine behaviors as well as tasks. They have a balanced identity that includes the virtues of both men and women and may disassociate the task with what gender it may be socially or physically assigned to. People who are androgynous disregard what traits are culturally constructed specifically for males and females within a specific society, and rather focus on what behavior is most effective within the situational circumstance.", "Genderqueer . The term has also been applied by those describing what they see as a gender ambiguity. \"Androgynous\" (also \"androgyne\") is frequently used as a descriptive term for people in this category. This is because the term androgyny is closely associated with a blend of socially defined masculine and feminine traits. However, not all genderqueer persons identify as androgynous. Some genderqueer people identify as a masculine woman or a feminine man or combine genderqueer with another gender option.", "Punk subculture . For some punks, the body was a symbol of opposition, a political statement expressing disgust of all that was \"normal\" and socially accepted. The idea was to make others outside of the subculture question their own views, which made gender, gender presentation and gender identity a popular factor to be played with. Men could look like women, women could look like men, or one could look like both or neither. In some ways, punk helped to tear apart the normalised view of gender as a dichotomy. There was a notable amount of cross-dressing in the punk scene; it was not unusual to see men wearing ripped-up skirts, fishnet tights and excessive makeup, or to see women with shaved heads wearing oversized plaid shirts and jean jackets and heavy combat boots. Punk created a new cultural space for androgyny and all kinds of gender expression. Some scholars have claimed that punk has been problematic towards gender by stating its overall resistance to expressing any kind of popular conceptions of femininity. In trying to reject societal norms, punk embraced one societal norm by deciding that strength and anger was best expressed through masculinity, defining masculine as the \"default\" in the world they were trying to create, where gender did not exist or had no meaning. However, the main reasoning behind this argument equates femininity with popular conceptions of beauty, which punk rejected.", "Gender . Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity.

People who do not identify as men or women or with masculine or feminine gender pronouns are often grouped under the umbrella terms \"non-binary\" or \"genderqueer\".

Ramses II, a 19th Dynasty pharaoh ruled Egypt from around 1279 to 1213 BCE. Among Ramses II many accomplishments, such as the expanding of the Egyptian borders, he constructed a massive temple called the Ramesseum. The temple is located near the city of Thebes, which at the time was the capital for the New kingdom pharaoh. The Ramesseum was a magnificent temple, completed with monument status to guard its entrance; the most impressive of which was a 62 foot tall statue of Ramses himself. Only fragments of this structure remain, particularly its base and torso are all that remain of the this impressive statue of the enthroned pharaoh, and thus the dimensions and weight (approximately 1000 pounds) are based on estimates. The temple was also accompanied with impressive reliefs many of which detail a number of Rames' military victories, such as the Battle of Kadesh (ca. 1274 BC) and the pillaging of the city \"Shalem\".", "Amun . While not regarded as a dynasty, the High Priests of Amun at Thebes were nevertheless of such power and influence that they were effectively the rulers of Egypt from 1080 to 943 BC. By the time Herihor was proclaimed as the first ruling High Priest of Amun in 1080 BC\u2014in the 19th Year of Ramesses XI\u2014the Amun priesthood exercised an effective hold on Egypt's economy. The Amun priests owned two-thirds of all the temple lands in Egypt and 90 percent of her ships and many other resources. Consequently, the Amun priests were as powerful as the Pharaoh, if not more so. One of the sons of the High Priest Pinedjem would eventually assume the throne and rule Egypt for almost half a decade as pharaoh Psusennes I, while the Theban High Priest Psusennes III would take the throne as king Psusennes II\u2014the final ruler of the 21st Dynasty. In the 10th century BC, the overwhelming dominance of Amun over all of Egypt gradually began to decline. In Thebes, however, his worship continued unabated, especially under the Nubian Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt, as Amun was by now seen as a national god in Nubia.  The Temple of Amun, Jebel Barkal, founded during the New Kingdom, came to be the center of the religious ideology of the Kingdom of Kush. The Victory Stele of Piye at Gebel Barkal (8th century BC) now distinguishes between an \"Amun of Napata\" and an \"Amun of Thebes\". Tantamani (died 653 BC), the last pharaoh of the Nubian dynasty, still bore a theophoric name referring to Amun in the Nubian form \"Amani\".", "New Kingdom of Egypt .

While Setnakhte's reign was still comparatively brief, it was just long enough for him to stabilize the political situation in Egypt and establish his son, Rameses III, as his successor to the throne of Egypt. The Bakenkhunsu stela reveals that it was Setnakhte who began the construction of a Temple of Amun-Re in Karnak which was eventually completed by his son, Ramesses III. Setnakhte also started work on a tomb, KV11, in the Valley of the Kings, but stopped it when the tombcarvers accidentally broke into the tomb of the Nineteenth Dynasty Pharaoh Amenmesse. Setnakhte then appropriated the tomb of Queen Twosret (KV14), his predecessor, for his own use. Setnakhte's origins are unknown, and he may have been a commoner, although many Egyptologists believe he was related to the previous dynasty, the Nineteenth, through his mother and may thus have been a grandson of Ramesses II.

This Dynasty was founded by Vizier Ramesses I, whom Pharaoh Horemheb chose as his successor to the throne.", "Napata . In 750 BC, Napata was a developed city, while Egypt was still suffering political instability. King Kashta (\"the Cushite\") profited from it, and attacked Upper Egypt. His policy was pursued by his successors Piye, and Shabaka (721\u2013707 BC), who eventually brought the whole Nile Valley under Kushitic control in the second year of his reign. Overall, the Kushite kings ruled Upper Egypt for approximately one century and the whole Egypt for approximately 57 years, from 721 to 664 BC. They constitute the Twenty-fifth Dynasty in Manetho\u2019s work, Aegyptiaca. The reunited Nile valley empire of the 25th dynasty was as large as it had been since the New Kingdom. The 25th dynasty ushered in a renaissance period for Ancient Egypt. Religion, the arts, and architecture were restored to their Old, Middle, and New Kingdom forms. Pharaohs, such as Taharqa, built or restored temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, Jebel Barkal, etc. It was during the 25th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom. However, Pharaoh Taharqa's reign and that of his successor, (his cousin) Tanutamun, was filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians. In 664 BC the Assyrians laid the final blow, sacking Thebes and Memphis. The 25th dynasty ended with its rulers retreating to their spiritual homeland at Napata. It was there (at El-Kurru and Nuri) that all 25th dynasty pharaohs are buried under the first pyramids that the Nile valley had seen in centuries. The Napatan dynasty led to the Kingdom of Kush, which flourished in Napata and Meroe until at least the 2nd century AD.", "Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt . The 25th dynasty was a line of pharaohs who originated in the Kingdom of Kush, located in present-day northern Sudan and southern Egypt. Most this dynasty's kings saw Napata as their spiritual homeland. They reigned in part or all of Ancient Egypt from 744\u2013656 BC. The dynasty began with Kashta's invasion of Upper Egypt and culminated in several years of both successful and unsuccessful war with the Mesopotamian based Assyrian Empire. The 25th Dynasty's reunification of Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and also Kush (Nubia) created the largest Egyptian empire since the New Kingdom. They assimilated into society by reaffirming Ancient Egyptian religious traditions, temples, and artistic forms, while introducing some unique aspects of Kushite culture. It was during the 25th dynasty that the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom.  After the Assyrian kings Sargon II and Sennacherib defeated attempts by the Nubian kings to gain a foothold in the Near East, their successors Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal invaded Egypt and defeated and drove out the Nubians. War with Assyria resulted in the end of Kushite power in Northern Egypt and the conquest of Egypt by Assyria. They were succeeded by the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt, initially a puppet dynasty installed by and vassals of the Assyrians, the last native dynasty to rule Egypt before the Persian Invasion.

Hatton Castle stands on the lower part of Hatton Hill, the most easterly of the Sidlaw Hills, to the south of Newtyle in Angus, Scotland. The castle overlooks the wooded Den of Newtyle, and its views extend across Strathmore and include Ben Lawers and Schiehallion as well as the Angus and Glenshee hills. The 16th-century castle was originally built in a typical Scottish \"Z plan\" tower house design, as a fortified country house or \"ch\u00e2teau\".

The name \"Hatton\" was adopted from the farm nearby. \"Hatton\" is a contraction of \"Hall-toun\", which in Scots means the farm (or \"ferm toun\") near the Hall (or \"Ha\"). Thus the Hall must have been there first, and the name \"Hatton\" actually refers to the adjacent farm, now known as Hatton Farm (the word farm is thus redundant, duplicating \"toun\"). Hatton Castle was probably originally called \"Newtyle Castle\", taking its name from the estate. In Scots, the word \"tyle\" means a roofing stone (not restricted to fired clay tiles as in English). There are brick and tile factories on the River Tay near Dundee, but \"Newtyle\" most likely relates to the sandstone quarried locally, and used extensively for building, dyking and roofing, as well as for carving into Pictish standing stones such as those preserved at the nearby Meigle Sculptured Stone Museum. The name \"New\"tyle rather implies that there was another place where sandstone was quarried previously.", "Hatton Castle, Angus . Hatton Castle was de-roofed in about 1720, after the 1715 Jacobite rising, when it was replaced by the Italian-style Belmont Castle in Meigle, which is now a Church of Scotland residential home.

This has been done faithfully, initially by Roderick Oliphant of Oliphant, yr and his elder brother Richard Oliphant of that Ilk (34th chief), so its charm remains much as it was in 1575, including glass hand-made in Edinburgh, in the leaded windows. Under-floor heating was installed (during the reconstruction) to avoid the sight of radiators. The exterior is harled with the traditional pinkish lime-based hand-daub.", "Hatton Castle, Angus .

As in the 16th century, music is again played most days in the Great Hall, and some memorable dances and house-concerts have been held. It is a regular gathering place for Scottish traditional musicians, notably hosting the creative network, 'Fiddle Force'. House Concerts are held, on a non-commercial basis, for a wide variety of artists, memorably including, for example, The Poozies, Barbaby Brown and John Kenny (Sardinian triple pipes and carnyx), Park Stickney (jazz harp), Philip Higham (Bach cello suites and more), Cathy Fraser from Australia, Fiddlelore from New Zealand, Douglas Lawrence, Gregor Borland and Sandy Brechin, Jarlath Henderson, Man's Ruin a variety of line-ups involving Ewan McPherson, Eskil Romme with his Danish band Himmerland, and The Chaps, from Dunedin.

Hislop, \"Book of Scottish Anecdote\", that the old Scots custom of 'enforced hospitality', to extract information from travellers, was demonstrated at Hatton Castle: \"The Lords Oliphant used to keep a cannon pointed to the road near by their old castle, so as to compel the wayfarers to come in and be regaled\". A cannon is still there today. Hatton was the home of the Masters of Oliphant rather than their fathers, who resided primarily at Aberdalgie and Dupplin Castles.", "Hatton Castle, Angus . No record exists of the original gardens of Hatton Castle, but a house of this scale would certainly have had fine gardens in the 16th and 17th centuries.

Until the 1990s when the current owner took it on, Hatton Castle stood in a gently sloping field full of sheep, cattle and a gaggle of geese from the adjacent curling pond. Sir James Cayzer, from the neighbouring Kinpurnie Estate planted standard trees in the surrounding parkland, and a garden is now emerging for Hatton Castle, featuring dry-stane dyking up to three metres high. This is the work of master-dyker Duncan Armstrong. An orchard of ancient Scottish apple varieties has been planted, as well as mulberry trees, and the sunken vegetable garden contains fig trees and artichokes. The eastern boundary of the garden of Hatton Castle is the Dundee and Newtyle Railway, which was the first railway line to open in the north of Scotland.

{"question": "The battle in which Giuseppe Arimondi lost his life secured what for Ethiopia?", "contexts": ["Giuseppe Galliano . In autumn 1895 all of Tigray was occupied; the Governor of Eritrea, General Oreste Baratieri returned to Massaua. A few weeks later, Negus Menelik II denounced the undue Italian occupation of Tigray, a territory that the Treaty of Wuchale assigned to Ethiopia. Menelik II collected huge supplies of provisions, cattle, arms and ammunitions and gathered a big army in order to march against the Italian column. In December the Abyssinian army could boast 100,000 men, while the Italian forces had been divided into two contingents: 5000 men were stationed in Adigrat and 5000 in Mek'ele, under General Giuseppe Arimondi. Arimondi intended to support Major Pietro Toselli, isolated with its company on the plateau of Amba Alagi in an advanced position. However Governor Baratieri telegraphed that the garrison in Mek'ele had to be maintained and prohibited general Arimondi from moving. On 7 December approximately 2000 soldiers, commanded by Major Toselli, died heroically.", "Giuseppe Galliano . In the last days of February, the Italian army had supplies only for a few days. It was necessary to retreat, or to advance to Adwa in order to reach the warehouses of Adi Ugri and Asmara. Baratieri was more favorable to the retreat but the others generals inclined for the attack. In the night between 29 February and 1 March, Baratieri decided at last to face the enemy with his 15,000 men against 120,000 of Menelik II. He was led to a risky manoeuvre, and to engage battle, by a telegram of Francesco Crispi (head of the government) sent on 25 February: \u201cThis one is a military tuberculosis, not a war\u201d. In the night of 29 February the army moved in three columns: Colonel Galliano took part to the center one, 2500 soldiers guided by General Giuseppe Arimondi. On the Rajo Mount, Galliano tried to cover the left wing of the brigade of Arimondi by blocking the Abyssinians. In this courageous effort he and all his Askaris fell. A second Gold Medal of Military Valor was conferred posthumous to Galliano. Galliano, the first alpine decorated with the gold medal, was also the first officer who received two Gold Medals of Military Valor, thus breaking off the tradition not to award it twice to the same person.", "Giuseppe Arimondi . On 12 February, pressed by the Prime Minister Francesco Crispi, Baratieri had his forces dug in at strong positions at Sauria, from Menelik's camp. By 27 February, the army had only a few days supply left and the intelligence wrongly reported that the Ethiopians were scattered across the hills of Adwa, foraging. Unable or unwilling to decide between a temporary withdrawal or a small advance, the Governor asked for the advice of his brigade commanders; Arimondi, Matteo Albertone, Vittorio Dabormida and the newly appointed Giuseppe Ellena. Arimondi estimated Menelik's forces at 50,000\u201360,000 warriors and, supported by his colleagues, urged for an aggressive approach.", "Battle of Debre Abbay .

In 1887, Arimondi was assigned as a staff officer to the expeditionary corps of General Alessandro Asinari di San Marzano and left for Eritrea, where he stayed until 1890. In 1892, he was promoted to colonel and sent again in Eritrea with full command of all native troops in the colony. In this position, he won a series of minor clashes and defeated the Dervishes under Emir Ahmed Al\u00ec at the Second Battle of Agordat in December 1893. In this battle, he remarkably decided to deploy his men in an extended battle line, with reserves echeloned at the rear. This caught by surprise the Mahdists, who were expecting close square formations as the ones adopted by British infantry in previous engagements. For this victory he received a promotion to major general.", "Giuseppe Arimondi . This situation eventually led to the massacre of Major Pietro Toselli's column. Isolated in an outpost at Amba Alagi, Toselli never received the order to retreat and was trapped by the army of Menelik. Arimondi, who had previously advanced to Ader\u00e0, away, was stopped by a telegram from Baratieri and forced to retreat. This left Toselli and Galliano to fend for themselves at the Battle of Amba Alagi and the Battle of Mek'ele.", "Giuseppe Arimondi . In 1894 he commanded the 2nd Operational Corps under General Oreste Baratieri, fighting the Battle of Kassala and the Battle of Coatit. Arimondi urged rapid and daring offensive manoeuvres, and quarreled with Baratieri's more cautious plans. When the Governor refused to support his projects of a preventive attack against Menelik II in Tigray, he twice requested permission to return home. The Minister of War refused, not willing to replace one of the most experienced colonial officers.", "Giuseppe Arimondi . Due to the broken ground which slowed his progress, Arimondi completed his movement at 9:00 a.m. Almost immediately he came upon a trickle of wounded soldiers from Albertone's brigade, which had been forced to retreat on the nearby mount Semaiata. Within half an hour the trickle became a stream and Baratieri sent Albertone orders to retire and reform under Arimondi's cover. It was too late: the Colonial Brigade, out of ammunition, disintegrated shortly afterwards. At 10:00 a.m. the Ethiopian forces, mixed with the disbanded Italians, launched their first assault on Arimondi's position.", "Giuseppe Arimondi . After the initial Ethiopian attacks were repulsed, Menelik sent his guard to outflank the left side of Arimondi's forces. The colonial battalion of Galliano, the only unit Ellena could detach to guard Arimondi's right flank, was overwhelmed. With his brigade hard pressed on the front and outflanked on both sides, General Arimondi was mortally wounded after two hours of fighting.

The concept of matched betting requires an account with two or more bookmakers or betting exchanges where at least one offers the user a free bet. When the free bet is placed the other bookmakers or betting exchanges are used to hedge all the possible outcomes so that no matter what happens the value of the free bet is retained. At its simplest, a matched bet involves placing a back bet using the free bet at a bookmaker while placing the opposing lay bet at a betting exchange. More advanced versions involve placing the bets on multiple bookmakers (dutching) to avoid the commission charged for using an exchange. Generally, bookmakers incorporate terms by which bettors must first place a bet using their own money in order to qualify for the free bet. For this, a bet is placed on particular results occurring with the bookmaker and a second bet placed on the same result not occurring at the betting exchange. The latter is required to offset any loss in the event that the result does not occur; for instance, if a team loses. Once the free bet has been qualified, the same process is followed with the exception that a free bet is being used. No matter which result occurs, there will always be a guaranteed profit because the bet was made free of charge. Online betting outlets, betting exchanges, have become popular in recent years for they allow betters to bet without official odds-makers.

A common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e.g. between half- and full siblings). In a study of seven different French breeds of dogs (Bernese mountain dog, basset hound, Cairn terrier, Epagneul Breton, German Shepherd dog, Leonberger, and West Highland white terrier) it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival. Another analysis of data on 42,855 dachshund litters, found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression.", "Leonberger . The Leonberger is a giant dog breed. The breed's name derives from the city of Leonberg in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany. According to legend, the Leonberger was ostensibly bred as a \"symbolic dog\" that would mimic the lion in the town crest. It is in the Working Group for dog shows such as Crufts, but not at the World Dog Show.", "Dog anatomy . The dog's muzzle size will come with the breed. The sizes of the muzzle have different names. Dogs with medium muzzles, such as the German Shepherd Dog, are called mesocephalic and dogs with a pushed in muzzle, such as the Pug, are called brachycephalic. Today's toy breeds have skeletons that mature in only a few months, while giant breeds, such as the Mastiffs, take 16 to 18\u00a0 months for the skeleton to mature. Dwarfism has affected the proportions of some breeds' skeletons, as in the Basset Hound.", "Basset Hound . Like all dogs, the Basset Hound's coat is naturally oily. The oil in their coat has a distinctive \"hound scent\", which is natural to the breed.", "Leonberger . Serious diseases can affect the Leonberger\u2014certain types of cancers are very common in the breed. Gastric dilatation volvulus, commonly called bloat, is another serious condition that affects many of the large- and giant-breed dogs, particularly those with deep chests. It causes the stomach to twist and can be fatal quite quickly. Adult Leonbergers should always be fed twice a day rather than one large meal to reduce the likelihood of bloat. Leonbergers are not alone in inheriting serious diseases, and according to the University of Sydney's LIDA taskforce, Leonbergers have relatively few health issues compared to other dog breeds.", "Basset Hound . The Basset Hound is a short-legged breed of dog of the hound family. The Basset is a scent hound that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare. Their sense of smell and ability to ground-scent is second only to that of the Bloodhound. Basset Hounds are one of 6 recognised basset-type breeds in France.

This bone growth abnormality may be a predisposing factor in the development of elbow dysplasia seen in the breed, which leads to arthritis of the elbow joint.", "Basset Hound .

While some of these dogs were certainly Basset Art\u00e9sien Normands, by the 1880s linebreeding had thrown back to a different heavier type. Everett Millais, who is considered to be the father of the modern Basset Hound, bred one such dog, Nicholas, to a Bloodhound bitch named Inoculation through artificial insemination in order to create a heavier basset in England in the 1890s.

Due to its strategic location between the continents of Europe and Africa and its proximity to the Strait of Gibraltar, Do\u00f1ana's large expanse of salt marsh is a breeding ground as well as a transit point for thousands of European and African birds (aquatic and terrestrial), and hosts many species of migratory waterfowl during the winter, typically up to 200,000 individuals. Over 300 different species of birds may be sighted there annually. Considered the largest nature reserve in Europe, several different scientific institutions have monitoring stations within its boundaries to ensure appropriate development of adjacent lands and conservation of the threatened species that inhabit it.

Valverde led the first organised scientific expedition to the Donana in 1957, joined by the British naturalists Guy Mountfort, Roger Peterson, and Sir Julian Huxley. A group of European conservation experts \u2013 including Guy Monfort, Max Nicholson and Luc Hoffmann \u2013then demonstrated the crucial importance of the area as a stopover for birds migrating between the European and African continents. In 1959, the Gonzalez family sold part of their land in Do\u00f1ana for development of the Matalasca\u00f1as resort. This alarmed European conservationists, leading various institutions and anonymous donors to offer to buy part of the property. Valverde, Hoffman, and Nicholson, in partnership with the British Nature Conservancy, formed an association that organised an international drive for funds to expand the park. The campaign raised two million Swiss Francs to buy 7,000 hectares of land for annexation to that already donated by Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon. Finally, in 1963 the Spanish government and WWF bought part of the territory and created the first Do\u00f1ana preserve, and in 1964 they established the Do\u00f1ana Biological Station and the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas - CSIC) to study the biodiversity of Do\u00f1ana and other Spanish ecosystems. In 1969, the WWF again joined forces with the Spanish government to purchase another section of the Guadalquivir Delta marshes and establish the Do\u00f1ana National Park. That same year the Do\u00f1ana National Park was created by decree, part of whose territory was owned by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad) and part still in private hands. Ten years later the protected area was expanded and the so-called \"Preparque Do\u00f1ana\" was created. In 1980, UNESCO recognised the Do\u00f1ana National Park as a Biosphere Reserve of 77,260 hectares. The Core Zone consists of 50,720 hectares in the National Park of Do\u00f1ana. The buffer zone is 54,250 hectares in the Natural Park of Do\u00f1ana. The altitude ranges from sea level to 40 meters above sea level. Unesco considers Do\u00f1ana of world significance, based on the variety of its ecosystems and the wide number of species they harbor. In 1982 it was included in the list of wetlands of the Ramsar Convention, and in 1989 the Regional Government of Andalusia converted the Preparque into the Do\u00f1ana Natural Park. In 1994 it was listed by Unesco as a World Heritage Site, enabling the establishment of programs to preserve and manage the area.

The screenplay was written by Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin, and Andres Heinz, based on an original story by Heinz. The film stars Natalie Portman, Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey and Winona Ryder. The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\" ballet by a prestigious New York City ballet company. The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina (Portman) is a perfect fit, as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities better embodied by the new arrival Lily (Kunis). Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the part, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into a living nightmare.", "Black Swan (film) . Darren Aronofsky first became interested in ballet when his sister studied dance at the High School of Performing Arts in New York City. The basic idea for the film started when he hired screenwriters to rework a screenplay called \"The Understudy\", which portrayed off-Broadway actors and explored the notion of being haunted by a double. Aronofsky said the screenplay had elements of \"All About Eve\", Roman Polanski's \"The Tenant\", and Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novella \"The Double\". The director had also seen numerous productions of \"Swan Lake\", and he connected the duality of the White Swan and the Black Swan to the script. When researching for the production of \"Black Swan\", Aronofsky found ballet to be \"a very insular world\" whose dancers were \"not impressed by movies\".

Aronofsky called \"Black Swan\" a companion piece to \"The Wrestler\", recalling one of his early projects about a love affair between a wrestler and a ballerina. He eventually separated the wrestling and the ballet worlds, considering them as \"too much for one movie\". He compared the two films: \"Wrestling some consider the lowest art\u2014if they would even call it art\u2014and ballet some people consider the highest art.

Block parties incorporated DJs who played popular genres of music, especially funk and soul music. For example, many DJs played music by the artist James Brown. Some songs played at these South Bronx house parties included \"Give it Up or Turn it Loose\" by James Brown and \"Get Ready\" by Rare Earth. Due to the positive reception, DJs began isolating the percussive breaks, or small portions of a song, often without vocals, which were easy to dance to, of popular songs.

The rhetoric of pharmaceutical and science commercialization is the study of the persuasive language and symbols that the pharmaceutical industry and biotechnology companies use to communicate and influence consumers, physicians, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders in the commercialization of biotechnology. Scholars have found that the language used to define, describe, and regulate pharmaceuticals influences the understanding and perception of the drugs among both the general public and experts. Information about pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and filtered through many channels as it moves from scientist to consumer. Despite the regulations on pharmaceutical advertising, pharmaceutical companies use carefully crafted direct-to-consumer advertising to rhetorically influence the patient-physician dialogue to drive consumption of specific pharmaceutical drugs. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies mislead physicians and scientists through deceptive rhetorical strategies in technical documentation (which both package inserts directed towards physicians and medical journal articles directed towards scientists). In a recent study, a pharmaceutical company disguised negative performance in one group of subjects by selectively merging data between different patient groups in clinical trials and carefully crafting supporting statements. This study shows that scientific data and knowledge is secondary to rhetorical messages supporting commercialization, and that human health is secondary to company profit. Notably, technical information is subject to obfuscation and distortion so that the message communicated outside of a commercial organization aligns with the primary goal of selling a product.

By the mid-1960s scientists found a way to get a larger amount of factor IX from FFP. By the late 1960s, pharmaceutical scientists found methods to separate the factor IX from plasma, which allows for neatly packaged bottles of factor IX concentrates. With the rise of factor IX concentrates it became easier for people to get treatment at home. Although these advances in medicine had a significant positive impact on the treatment of haemophilia, there were many complications that came with it. By the early 1980s, scientists discovered that the medicines they had created were transferring blood-borne viruses, such as hepatitis, and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. With the rise of these deadly viruses, scientists had to find improved methods for screening the blood products they received from donors.In 1982, scientists made a breakthrough in medicine and were able to clone factor IX gene.

Like most developmental timelines it is important to consider that no two children develop at the same pace. Infant gesture is thought to be an important part of the prelinguistic period and prepares a child for the emergence of language. It has been suggested that language and gesture develop in interaction with one another. It is believed that gestures are easier to produce for both infants and adults; this is supported by the fact that infants begin to communicate with gestures before they can produce words. The first type of gestures that appear in infants are deictic gestures. Deictic gestures include pointing, which is often the most common gesture produced at ten months of age. At eleven months of age children can produce a sequence of 2 gestures, usually a deictic gesture with a conventional or representational gesture. and by twelve months of age children can begin to produce 3-gestures in sequence usually a representational or conventional gesture that is preceded and followed by a deictic gesture. Around twelve months of age, infants begin to use representational gestures. In relation to language acquisition, representational gestures appear around the same time as first words. At age 18 months children produce more deictic gestures than representational gestures. Between the first and second year of life, children begin to learn more words and use gestures less. At 26 months of age, there is an increase in iconic gesture use and comprehension. Gestures become more complex as children get older. Between age 4-6 children can use whole body gestures when describing a route. A whole body gesture occurs in three-dimensional space and is used when the speaker is describing a route as if they are on it. At ages 5\u20136, children also describe a route from a bird's eye view and use representational gestures from this point of view. The ways in which gestures are used are an indication of the developmental or conceptual ability of children.", "Gesture-enhanced single-touch . An important technical reason for the limitation to gesture-enhanced single-touch instead of allowing dual-touch or multi-touch is the type of sensor hardware in the display. Many touchscreen technologies obtain two independent measurements per touch to acquire a 2-dimensional position. Given two distinct touches, however, this returns two pairs of measurements, which can be combined in two ways, producing an ambiguous result. Thus, it is not possible to exactly determine the position of two distinct touches. Still, the average position can be approximated, as well as the distance between the touches, which suffices for some gesture applications.", "The Saimaa Gesture .

Tharoor's book has been challenged by a number of historians, Indian and British. In a review published in the Cambridge Review of International Affairs in 2017 the economic historian, Professor Tirthankar Roy, who teaches South Asia and Global History at the London School of Economics and whose recent publications include India in the world economy from antiquity to the present, has described Tharoor's grasp of economic history as 'ill-informed' and his political history 'naive'. He praised Inglorious Empire as for its 'passion and plain good writing' while adding that 'none one of these qualities makes the interpretation right, however'. Roy challeges the central thesis of Tharoor's argument in support of the so-called 'Drain theory': The idea that India was a prosperous society, which British repression made poor, has circulated through academic and political circles since 1900, especially within the Indian National Congress, the political party in which Tharoor belongs. The best part of the book restate this old idea. Structurally, the claim that India was great until British repression made it poor is suspiciously similar to the claim the Hindu nationalists make today - that India was great until Islamic represion from roughly the thirteenth century made it poor. The similarity is not accidental. Both are distinctly political narratives. The Congress [Party] needed the story to fight British rule in the early twentieth century. It was a useful weapon then. But was it ever the correct story? In fact, generations of historians (none cited in the book) have shown that it is not.", "Cliometrics . Cliometrics (), sometimes called new economic history, or econometric history, is the systematic application of economic theory, econometric techniques, and other formal or mathematical methods to the study of history (especially social and economic history). It is a quantitative (as opposed to qualitative or ethnographic) approach to economic history. The term \"cliometrics\" comes from Clio, who was the muse of history, and was originally coined by the mathematical economist Stanley Reiter in 1960. There has been a revival in 'new economic history' since the late 1990s. The new economic history originated in 1958 with \"The Economics of Slavery in the Antebellum South\" by American economists Alfred H. Conrad and John R. Meyer, which caused a firestorm of controversy with its claim, based on statistical data, that slavery, being economically efficient and highly profitable for slaves owners, would not have ended in the absence of the U.S. Civil War. The new economic history revolution actually began in the mid-1960s and was resisted because many incumbent economic historians were either historians or economists who had very little connection to economic modeling or statistical techniques. Areas of key interest included transportation history, slavery, and agriculture. Cliometrics became better known when Douglass North and William Parker became the editors of the \"Journal of Economic History\" in 1960. The Cliometrics Meetings began to be held around this time at Purdue University and are still held annually in different locations. Today, cliometric approaches are standard in several journals, including the \"Journal of Economic History\", \"Explorations in Economic History\", the \"European Review of Economic History\", and \"Cliometrica\"."], "ground_truth": "9 January 18898", "answer": "David Kenneth Fieldhouse was born on 7 June 1925."}

Standard maintenance include removing debris, controlling weeds, deadhead trimming, checking moisture levels, and fertilizing. The maintenance energy use for green roofs has many variables including: climate, intensity of rainfall, type of building, type of vegetation, and external coatings. The most significant effect comes from scarce rainfall which will increase the maintenance energy due to the watering required. During a 10-year roof maintenance cycle a house with a green roof requires more retrofit embodied energy than a house with a white roof. The individual components of a green roof have CO implications during the manufacturing process have additional implications compared to a conventional roof. The embodied energy for green roof components are CO per square meter of green roof. This value is equivalent to 6448 g C m which is significantly greater than 378 g C m", "Green roof . A concentration of green roofs in an urban area can even reduce the city's average temperatures during the summer, combating the urban heat island effect.

On Chicago's City Hall, by contrast, which features a green roof, roof temperatures on a hot day are typically cooler than they are on traditionally roofed buildings nearby. Green roofs are becoming common in Chicago, as well as in Atlanta, Portland, and other United States cities, where their use is encouraged by regulations to combat the urban heat-island effect. Green roofs are a type of low impact development. In the case of Chicago, the city has passed codes offering incentives to builders who put green roofs on their buildings. The Chicago City Hall green roof is one of the earliest and most well-known examples of green roofs in the United States; it was planted as an experiment to determine the effects a green roof would have on the microclimate of the roof.

This is a sufficient proof that the second and third parts were not written without dependence on the first.\" Numerous more recent scholars continue to uphold Johnson's argument. E. M. W.

Sugar Ray originally began their career as a hardcore punk band, before introducing a DJ into the band's musical composition, resulting in their first shift in style. This new sound fused hair metal and hardcore punk with funk, sample-based hip-hop, new wave, disco, dub, reggae, R&B and soul music. This sound has been predominately categorized as nu metal and funk metal, as well as alternative metal, hard rock, punk rock and rap metal. Regarding the band's early music, singer Mark McGrath stated, \"we were the Chili Peppers with zero talent. [...] Out of necessity we kind of became known as a metal band, a little pre nu-metal type rap rock thing before there was rap rock.\"", "Funk metal . By the latter part of the 90s, the genre was represented by a smaller group of bands, including Incubus, Sugar Ray, Jimmie's Chicken Shack and 311. Bands from other genres such as nu metal (Korn, Primer 55, and Bloodhound Gang ) and punk ( Snot, Zebrahead) also incorporated elements of funk metal into their sound during the late 90s and early 2000s. Popular 80s and early 90s acts such as Faith No More, Mr. Bungle and Red Hot Chili Peppers had largely abandoned the sound in favor of other styles by this point. AllMusic suggests the genre was \"played-out by the end of the decade\".", "Indian rock . Indian funk is a loose term describing the style of rock and roll which is sometimes blurred into the realms of pop and other genres. Whereas Indian fusion may only incorporate Indian styles into rock, or rock into Indian forms of music, Indian funk can be broadly defined as what rap-metal is to heavy metal - an infusion of elements from rap, reggae, pop and dance genres that some might consider to not be 'true' rock. Groups originating in South Asian communities in Western countries like Britain are noted for this style, with bands such as Swami and Asian Dub Foundation using elements of UK garage, UK bhangra and hip-hop, such as synthesizers, rap vocals and turntables. Also based in the UK, Botown take an approach inspired by Funkadelic with a large lineup of live musicians to blend Bollywood music with soul and funk.

The single 'Fly' is a perfect summer confection that's as irresistible as it is lightweight.\" Allmusic wrote, \"Sugar Ray's second album, \"Floored\", is a noticeable improvement from \"Lemonade and Brownies\". The group's fusion of metal, funk, reggae, and rap is seamless and confident, partially because Sugar Ray now emphasize the groove, not the guitars. The group still has difficulty writing a consistent batch of songs, but its hooks are stronger than ever.\"", "Funk rock . Seattle rock band Mother Love Bone is also known to have funk-like grooves in their music. An example of this can be heard in their song \"Holy Roller\". Keziah Jones, Seal, and Stevie Salas released funk rock albums. And in the early 1990s, several bands combined funky rhythms with heavy metal guitar sounds, resulting in \"funk metal\", where the emphasis is in using much heavier distorted guitar sounds in the mix. Funk rock employs more of a lighter, \"crunchier\" distorted guitar sound, and the musical emphasis tends to be more beat-driven with prominent bass lines; more rhythmic in the R&B sense. One of the best examples of the fusion can be heard on the critically acclaimed \"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\" album, released in 1991 by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Other notable 1990s artists in the funk rock genre, although not widely known in North America, include guitarist Stevie Salas and funk metal bassist TM Stevens.

Byrd gave presentations and wrote several articles for the Foundation for Apologetic Information & Research dealing with homosexuality. He wrote critically of \"No More Goodbyes\", written by LDS author Carol Lynn Pearson, and \"In Quiet Desperation\", a book about an LDS man's efforts to faithfully live the LDS religion while having same-sex attractions. In turn, his critique was criticized by other Mormon counselors, as well as by one of the book's authors, Ty Mansfield.", "Jeffrey Weeks (sociologist) . Weeks is the author of several books, including \"Coming Out\" (Quartet, 1977), a study of the history of homosexual politics in Britain, \"Sex, Politics and Society\" (Longman, 1981), and \"Sexuality and Its Discontents\" (Routledge, 1985).", "Havelock Ellis . The 1897 English translation of Ellis's book \"Sexual Inversion\", co-authored with John Addington Symonds and originally published in German in 1896, was the first English medical textbook on homosexuality. It describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys. Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, as he did not characterise it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age taboos as well as gender taboos.", "Richard C. Friedman . He later wrote \"Sexual Orientation and Psychoanalysis\" (2002), co-authored with Jennifer I. Downey, which focuses on the role of psychoanalysis in the understanding of sexual orientation in both sexes. This book discusses in particular detail the role played by psychotherapy in ameliorating the long-term effects of anti-homosexual prejudice. More recently, Friedman and Downey were the first to study the relevance of sexual differentiation of behavior to psychoanalytic theory and practice, arguing that the psychoanalytic approach to psychological development and functioning needed widespread revision.", "Albert Ellis . In 1958, Ellis published his classic work \"Sex Without Guilt\" which came to be known for its advocacy of a liberal attitude towards sex. He contributed to Paul Krassner's magazine \"The Realist\"; among its articles, in 1964 he wrote \"if this be heresy... Is pornography harmful to children?\" In 1965, Ellis published a book entitled \"Homosexuality: Its Causes and Cure\", which partly saw homosexuality as a pathology and therefore a condition to be cured. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association reversed its position on homosexuality by declaring that it was not a mental disorder and thus not properly subject to cure, and in 1976, Ellis clarified his earlier views in \"Sex and the Liberated Man\", expounding that some homosexual disturbed behaviors may be subject to treatment but, in most cases, that should not be attempted as homosexuality is not inherently good or evil, except from a religious viewpoint (See \"Ellis and religion\", below). Near the end of his life, he finally updated and re-wrote \"Sex Without Guilt\" in 2001 and released as \"Sex Without Guilt in the Twenty-First Century\". In this book, he expounded and enhanced his humanistic view on sexual ethics and morality and dedicated a chapter on homosexuality to giving homosexuals advice and suggestion on how to more greatly enjoy and enhance their sexual love lives. While preserving some of the ideas about human sexuality from the original, the revision described his later humanistic opinions and ethical ideals as they had evolved in his academic work and practice.", "Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women . Wittenberg wrote that the book was certain to become an instant classic and that it fully deserved this status. Morin described the book as a \"long-awaited publication\", but did not consider its authors' findings surprising. He wrote that Bell and Weinberg appeared to have found \"difficulty in dealing with the diversity of experiences that they found among their gay respondents\". While appreciating Bell and Weinberg's attempts to discredit stereotypes about homosexuals, he found their division of homosexuals into different \"types\" to be in effect the creation of a new set of stereotypes. He called Bell and Weinberg's typology of homosexuals \"arbitrary and misleading.\" He argued that while the book was a \"fine historical document\", its data only reflected the situation in San Francisco in 1969 and 1970. He denied that Bell and Weinberg had a representative sample, and suggested that a representative sample of homosexuals was impossible given that they were \"basically an invisible population\". He also accused Bell and Weinberg of drawing \"conclusions well beyond their data.\" While he considered \"Homosexualities\" a helpful work, and useful on a political level, he did not consider it \"a sophisticated research study\". He wrote that the book was \"disappointing and consistent with the downward trend in the quality of reports emanating from the Institute for Sex Research\", and criticized Bell and Weinberg for ignoring \"issues of growth and the ways in which diversity may lead to insights which might be helpful to all men and women exploring the creative violation of sex roles.\"", "Hormones and Brain Differentiation . Hormones and Brain Differentiation is a 1976 book about homosexuality and transsexualism by G\u00fcnter D\u00f6rner, in which the author advocates manipulating the sex hormone levels of pregnant women to prevent their children from becoming homosexual, and, based on experiments on rats, proposes brain surgery as a method of altering the sexual orientation of adult homosexuals. The book formed part of a 1970s campaign by D\u00f6rner to prevent homosexuality, and like other parts of his work has been controversial.", "Sex and Reason . Anderson described the book as \"ambitious\", and wrote that it \"contains much to please and enrage people on all sides of the issues considered\" and was \"often brilliant, but occasionally obtuse\". He credited Posner with providing an erudite review of the \"literature on the biology, history, philosophy, psychology, and sociology of sex\", and with making a generally compelling argument that much of the variance in sexual behavior and customs across cultures and eras is explained by a handful of factors. He predicted that because of its author's influence, the book would be widely cited in legal briefs, especially but not only by civil libertarians, and wrote that it demonstrated considerable courage because it was likely to alienate his conservative supporters. He suggested that homosexuality plays a central role in the book, and credited Posner with establishing that sexual orientation is unchosen, \"may well be biologically determined\", and is unchangeable. However, he believed that the book would have benefited from applied research, and that Posner presented an incomplete analysis of sex. He found Posner's data on sexuality to be of disappointing quality, writing that he had made insufficient efforts to \"obtain demographic data on sexual minorities, and lesbians in particular\". He also predicted that some of his theoretical analysis would be controversial, especially those concerning abortion and infanticide, and that some of his conclusions about homosexuality were incorrect. He criticized Posner for implying that conventionally masculine men are necessarily heterosexual, for asserting that not only European countries, but also Latin American countries, the Philippines, and Japan are significantly more tolerant of homosexuality than the United States, for his treatment of rape, which he considered unclear and debatable in its conclusions about rapists' motives, and his treatment of the issue of whether prostitution should be legalized, which he found inconsistent. He criticized Posner for failing to \"articulate a theory of the appropriate role for criminal penalties as opposed to other regulatory actions\", which he believed would have helped Posner to reach unambiguous conclusions, the details of Posner's economic analysis, his arguments against welfare programs, and his discussion of same-sex marriage.", "Sexual Preference (book) . Peplau \"et al.\" wrote in the \"Annual Review of Sex Research\" that while Bell \"et al.\"\u2032s suggestion that biological factors have a stronger influence on exclusive homosexuality than they have on bisexuality may seem plausible, it has not been directly tested and appears to conflict with available evidence, such as that concerning prenatal hormone exposure. The psychologist Bruce Rind credited Bell \"et al.\" with disproving psychoanalytic theories about the development of homosexuality, along with the idea that childhood seduction causes homosexuality. The psychologist Mark Yarhouse wrote that while the Bell \"et al.\" study is cited by proponents of a biological explanation, it relies on retrospective memory recall, which can be unreliable. The psychologist J. Michael Bailey and his co-authors, writing in \"Psychological Science in the Public Interest\", described \"Sexual Preference\" as a \"landmark study\" that \"seemingly disposed of the idea that homosexuality resulted from the quality of parent-child relationships.\"", "Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women .

Ravenna is a city in Northeastern Italy that served as the capital of the Ostrogothic Kingdom which existed between 493 and 553 CE. During that time Ravenna saw a great renovation, in particular under Theodoric the Great (454\u2013526). During his rule Ravenna saw many of its finest monuments constructed or renovated including the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, the Palace of Theoderic and Mausoleum of Theodoric. Many of these monuments reflected Theodoric's, as well as the Goths as a people, religion of Arian Christianity. Though an Arian Christian himself, Theodoric's rule was a time of religious tolerance in the city of Ravenna. His religious tolerance extended also to forging a balance between the Romans and Goths in Ravenna. Theodoric attempted to model Ravenna as a capital equivalent to that of Rome or Constantinople and as such was a defender of classical antiquity in a western world that saw much of its classical heritage disappearing.", "Ravenna .

They built large defensive stone structures without mortar such as Great Zimbabwe, capital of the Kingdom of Zimbabwe, Khami, capital of Kingdom of Butua, and Danangombe (Dhlo-Dhlo), capital of the Rozwi Empire. The Swahili people themselves were the inhabitants of the East African coast from Kenya to Mozambique who traded extensively with Asians and Arabs, who introduced them to Islam.

Around 500, Theodoric celebrated his thirtieth anniversary as King of the Ostrogoths. In order to improve their chances against the Roman Empire the Ostrogoths and Visigoths began again to unite in what became a loose confederation of Germanic peoples.

The Kovno ghetto was a ghetto established by Nazi Germany to hold the Lithuanian Jews of Kaunas during the Holocaust. At its peak, the Ghetto held 29,000 people, most of whom were later sent to concentration and extermination camps, or were shot at the Ninth Fort. About 500 Jews escaped from work details and directly from the Ghetto, and joined Soviet partisan forces in the distant forests of southeast Lithuania and Belarus.", "History of the Jews in Poland . A group of fighters escaped from the ghetto through the sewers and reached the Lomianki forest. About 50 ghetto fighters were saved by the Polish \"People's Guard\" and later formed their own partisan group, named after Anielewicz. Even after the end of the uprising there were still several hundreds of Jews who continued living in the ruined ghetto. Many of them survived thanks to the contacts they managed to establish with Poles outside the ghetto. The Uprising inspired Jews throughout Poland. Many Jewish leaders who survived the liquidation continued underground work outside the ghetto. They hid other Jews, forged necessary documents and were active in the Polish underground in other parts of Warsaw and surrounding area. Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, was followed by other Ghetto uprisings in many smaller towns and cities across German occupied Poland. Many Jews were found alive in the ruins of the former Warsaw Ghetto during the 1944 general Warsaw Uprising when the Poles themselves rose up against the Germans. Some of the survivors of 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, still held in camps at or near Warsaw, were freed during 1944 Warsaw Uprising, led by the Polish resistance movement Armia Krajowa, and immediately joined Polish fighters. Only a few of them survived. The Polish commander of one Jewish unit, Waclaw Micuta, described them as some of the best fighters, always at the front line. It is estimated that over 2,000 Polish Jews, some as well known as Marek Edelman or Icchak Cukierman, and several dozen Greek, Hungarian or even German Jews freed by Armia Krajowa from Gesiowka concentration camp in Warsaw, men and women, took part in combat against Nazis during 1944 Warsaw Uprising. Some 166,000 people lost their lives in the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, including perhaps as many as 17,000 Polish Jews who had either fought with the AK or had been discovered in hiding (\"see:\" Krzysztof Kamil Baczy\u0144ski and Stanis\u0142aw Aronson). Warsaw was razed to the ground by the Germans and more than 150,000 Poles were sent to labor or concentration camps. On January 17, 1945, the Soviet Army entered destroyed and nearly uninhabited Warsaw. Some 300 Jews were found hiding in the ruins in the Polish part of the city (\"see:\" Wladyslaw Szpilman). The fate of the Warsaw Ghetto was similar to that of the other ghettos in which Jews were concentrated. With the decision of Nazi Germany to begin the Final Solution, the destruction of the Jews of Europe, Aktion Reinhard began in 1942, with the opening of the extermination camps of Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka, followed by Auschwitz-Birkenau where people were killed in gas chambers and mass executions (death wall). Many died from hunger, starvation, disease, torture or by pseudo-medical experiments. The mass deportation of Jews from ghettos to these camps, such as happened at the Warsaw Ghetto, soon followed, and more than 1.7 million Jews were killed at the Aktion Reinhard camps by October 1943 alone.", "Executions in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto (1943\u20131944) . It is impossible to determine the exact number of victims of executions carried out in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto. Krzysztof Dunin-W\u0105sowicz calculated that between January 1, 1943 and July 31, 1944, in secret or open executions carried out in Warsaw, the German occupiers murdered about 20,500 people, most of whom were in all probability executed in the former \"Jewish residential district\". According to IPN historians, around 20,000 people were murdered in the ruins of the ghetto between 1943 and 1944, including around 10,000 Poles. It is difficult to determine, however, how many of the murdered were prisoners of KL Warschau (mostly Jews from various European countries) and how many were the residents of Warsaw or the surrounding towns shot in retaliation executions. Hence, the probable number of victims of murders carried out in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto amounts to several thousand. According to W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bartoszewski's calculations \u2013 based mainly on estimates of underground reports of the Pawiak cells and covering only those executions in which it was possible to determine at least the approximate number of victims \u2013 about 9600 people were murdered in the ruins of the ghetto between May 7, 1943 and August 13, 1944.", "Kovno Ghetto .

The Ronda movements can be purchased by watch repair shops for $23 retail; however, it's been pointed out that Swiss Made ETA movements (used in many \"Swiss Made\" luxury watches) can also be purchased in bulk for around $20. Furthermore, while the standards for labeling a watch \"American Made\" in the USA is that nearly 100% of the parts must be physically fabricated in America, the legal standard in Switzerland for \"Swiss Made\" is that no more than 40% of the \"value\" of the watch can be fabricated overseas.

She became a fashion icon during the silent film era, beginning with her success in the film \"The Toll of the Sea\" (1922), the first color feature to be made in Hollywood. During her career she sought roles that portrayed Chinese and Asian Americans in a positive light, but these films never became famous except for a select few such as the film \"Daughter of Shanghai\" (1937). Frustrated by being stereotyped and typecast during her career in the United States, she moved to Europe, where she appeared in many plays and films, the most notable of which was the British film \"Piccadilly\" (1929). She later returned to the United States in an ironic twist, at a time when American studios were searching Europe for fresh new talent, despite the fact that she is an American. She returned with promises of leading roles, but these did not come about due to racism in the United States. She eventually stopped acting in professional films and turned to stage, cabaret, B movies, and anti-Japanese propaganda films such as \"Bombs Over Burma\" (1943) due to her being an advocacy against the Japanese aggression in China. She was set to make her comeback with the film \"Flower Drum Song\" (1961) but was unable due to failing health. Despite a prolific career Wong's only film to have ever been a truly big success was \"Shanghai Express\" (1932). Sessue Hayakawa was the first and one of the few Asian American/Asian actors to find stardom in the United States and Europe and was also the first leading Asian male actor in the United States. He became the first male sex symbol of Hollywood long before and the precursor to Rudolph Valentino. His fame rivaled that of Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin. His fame began during the silent film era, leading into sound pictures in his later life. He became a film actor in a somewhat reluctant and accidental manner when the famous producer Thomas Ince saw his theatre play \"The Typhoon\" and wanted to turn it into a silent film and when it was released the film was an instant hit. With rising stardom he was eventually offered film contract by Famous Players-Lasky now Paramount Pictures. His second film with the production company, \"The Cheat\" (1915), was a success and made him a romantic hit with U.S. female audiences. He became a leading man of romance films, considered a heartthrob and a sex symbol; many actresses wanted to work with him in films, in which he was often cast as the exotic male Asian lover that women desired. After years of being typecast as a villain and exotic Asian lover that white women could not have, he decided to start his own production company, where he eventually made 23 films; he produced, starred in, and directed them, and contributed to their design, writing and editing. His films also influenced the way the United States viewed Asians. He personally chose American actress Marin Sais to appear opposite him in his films such as \"The City of Dim Faces\" and \"His Birthright\". Hayakawa's collaboration with Sais ended with the film \"Bonds of Honor\" (1919). In 1919, Hayakawa made what is generally considered one of his best films, \"The Dragon Painter\". After some bad business, he left the United States and for the next 15 years he worked in Europe and Japan where he made many popular films and plays such as the films \"The Great Prince Chan\" and the play \"Samurai\" which he performed for the king and queen of the United Kingdom at that time King George V and Queen Mary and a stage play version of \"The Three Musketeers\". His fame in France came from France's fascination with anything Asian. In the 1930s with the rise of Talkies and growing Anti-Japanese sentiment due to World War II. During the war, he tried to perform in Europe but eventually became trapped by the Germans and for years was not able to work as an actor until Humphrey Bogart tracked him and down and offered him a role in the his film \"Tokyo Joe\" (1949) which became a hit and afterwards he did another successful film \"Three Came Home\" (1950). After the war his image in films this time was as the honorable villain which he became typecasted as and from it he starred in what is considered to be his most famous film of his entire career \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957) for which he was nominated for both an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award. Merle Oberon an actress of Old Hollywood starred in many successful films, and was nominated for the Oscar for Best actress for the film \"The Dark Angel\" (1935) and is most renowned for her performance in the film version of \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939). In the United Kingdom, she starred in the successful films \"The Private Life of Henry VIII\" (1933) and \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" (1934). Despite her success as an actress, Oberon hid her Indian heritage due to her history of discrimination growing up in India. So much so she invented a fake story of the origin of her birth and early life. Miyoshi Umeki won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in for \"Sayonara\" (1957).

{"question": "Whose helmet is it discovered in 1939 which is well preserved and together with the Coppergate Helmet?", "contexts": ["Sutton Hoo helmet . The primary structural similarity between the Sutton Hoo and other Anglo-Saxon helmets lies in the presence of cheek guards, a feature shared by the Coppergate, Wollaston and Staffordshire helmets, yet generally missing from their Scandinavian counterparts. The construction of the Sutton Hoo helmet is otherwise largely distinguished from all other Anglo-Saxon examples. Its cap is unique in having been raised from a single piece of iron. The caps of the other helmets were each composed of at least eight pieces. On the iron Coppergate, Shorwell and Wollaston helmets, a brow band was joined by a nose-to-nape band, two lateral bands, and four infill plates, while the Benty Grange helmet was constructed from both iron and horn. A brow band was joined both by nose-to-nape and ear-to-ear bands and by four strips subdividing the resultant quadrants into eighths. Eight pieces of horn infilled the eight open spaces, with the eight joins each covered by an additional strip of horn. The Sutton Hoo helmet is also the only known Anglo-Saxon helmet to have either a face mark or a fixed neck guard; the Coppergate and Benty Grange helmets, the only others to have any surviving form of neck protection, used camail and horn, respectively, and together with the Wollaston helmet protected the face by use of nose-to-nape bands elongated to form nasals.", "Newstead Helmet . The helmet was discovered during excavations by James Curle during 1905 at the Roman fort of Trimontium, which is located near the triple peak of Eildon Hill at Newstead, after which the fort is named (Trimontium meaning \"three hills\"). During excavations between February 1905 and September 1910, Curle discovered a large number of Roman military artefacts at the fort, including items of Roman armour, horse harnesses, saddle plates, and several ornate bronze and iron cavalry helmets for parade use. Only one helmet found in 1905 is largely complete and preserves the face mask, and this is known as \"the Newstead Helmet\". This helmet was discovered in a pit dating to the Flavian period (69\u201396) in the south annexe of the fort.", "Guilden Morden boar . Understood in its broader context, the boar would likely have adorned an early model of the \"crested helmets\" known in Northern Europe in the sixth through eleventh centuries AD. Though the remains of fifty such helmets are known, most are from Scandinavia and only five from the Anglo-Saxon period are preserved enough that their original form can be determined. These, the helmets from Benty Grange, Sutton Hoo, Coppergate, Wollaston and Staffordshire, may have shared similarities with the helmet to which the Guilden Morden boar was attached. Scandinavian helmets are also depicted artistically with boar crests, such as on one of the four Torslunda plates found in Sweden. The boars atop the helmets worn by the two warriors on the plate are highly similar to the one from Guilden Morden, and similarly appear to be fastened to their helmets with a pin and socket device.", "Shorwell helmet . The \"fragmentary iron vessel\" was conserved at the British Museum. It had been located close to where the head of the body would have been, and so was reconstructed in the chance that it might actually be a helmet. In this manner it joined the Roman helmet from Burgh Castle, mislabeled for two decades as \"cauldron fragments\", the Anglo-Saxon Pioneer helmet, first labeled a \"bucket\", and the Anglo-Saxon Coppergate helmet, thought at first to be a rock. The fragments were extensively corroded as well as distorted, complicating the restoration; layers of metal had also delaminated in places, requiring that the layers be adhered before they could be joined to adjacent fragments along the broken edges. The pieces were only lightly cleaned to preserve traces of organic remains, and X-rays were first used to sort the fragments by density and curvature. Approximately two-thirds of the helmet was then assembled and adhered, proving it for what it was. The unincorporated fragments were insufficient to account for the missing third of the helmet, suggesting that it had been damaged by ploughing.", "Pioneer Helmet . The sparsely decorated nature of the helmet, a utilitarian iron fighting piece, belies its rarity. It is one of just six Anglo-Saxon helmets yet discovered, joined by finds from Benty Grange, Sutton Hoo, York, Shorwell and Staffordshire; its basic form is nearly identical to that of the richer Coppergate helmet found in York. Like these, the Pioneer Helmet is an example of the \"crested helmets\" that flourished in England and Scandinavia from the sixth through eleventh centuries.", "Coppergate Helmet . The pit in which the helmet was found was lined with oak planks that had been pressed into the clay. It was most probably a well; the lack of food or human parasite ova remains suggests that it was not a toilet or cesspit, while plant and animal remains are consistent with an open, aquatic environment. The helmet appears to have been intentionally hidden within it, probably with the intention of recovery. The sinister cheek piece and the camail had been carefully removed and placed inside the cap, which was then placed upside down in the pit, keeping the three parts together. At the same time, the random assortment of items also found in the pit does not suggest that the helmet was deposited as a type of offering. The volatile state of York during the eighth and ninth centuries would have given the helmet's owner ample opportunity to consider hiding it in a well. The Vikings invaded York in 866, the Northumbrians, unsuccessfully, a year later. Nor had the preceding century of Northumbrian rule been peaceful; between 758 and 867, every King of Northumbria whose fate is known was either murdered, killed in battle or forced out.

This was done manually, using brushes and a scalpel, with an eye towards preserving the corrosion which itself retained the original surface texture of the helmet. Micro-abrasive blasting was used on some areas such as the sinister cheek guard, after its broken fragments were adhered together, as the corrosion was too heavy and the surfaces too fragile to press against with the scalpel. Most of the brass fittings needed only cleaning with glass bristle brush, and the interior of the cap was only lightly cleaned, leaving material for possible future analysis.

He made major contributions to a number of fields, including mathematics (foundations of mathematics, functional analysis, ergodic theory, representation theory, operator algebras, geometry, topology, and numerical analysis), physics (quantum mechanics, hydrodynamics, and quantum statistical mechanics), economics (game theory), computing (Von Neumann architecture, linear programming, self-replicating machines, stochastic computing), and statistics.", "Jewish culture .

Emmy Noether was an influential mathematician known for her groundbreaking contributions to abstract algebra and theoretical physics. Described by many prominent scientists as the most important woman in the history of mathematics, she revolutionized the theories of rings, fields, and algebras. In physics, Noether's theorem explains the fundamental connection between symmetry and conservation laws.", "John von Neumann . Von Neumann was the first to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics, known as the Dirac\u2013von Neumann axioms, with his 1932 work \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\". After having completed the axiomatization of set theory, he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics. He realized, in 1926, that a state of a quantum system could be represented by a point in a (complex) Hilbert space that, in general, could be infinite-dimensional even for a single particle. In this formalism of quantum mechanics, observable quantities such as position or momentum are represented as linear operators acting on the Hilbert space associated with the quantum system.", "Von Neumann entropy . John von Neumann established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics in his 1932 work \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\". In it, he provided a theory of measurement, where the usual notion of wave-function collapse is described as an irreversible process (the so-called von Neumann or projective measurement).", "Quantum logic . In his classic 1932 treatise \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\", John von Neumann noted that projections on a Hilbert space can be viewed as propositions about physical observables. The set of principles for manipulating these quantum propositions was called \"quantum logic\" by von Neumann and Birkhoff in their 1936 paper. George Mackey, in his 1963 book (also called \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\"), attempted to provide a set of axioms for this propositional system as an \"orthocomplemented lattice\". Mackey viewed elements of this set as potential \"yes or no questions\" an observer might ask about the state of a physical system, questions that would be settled by some measurement. Moreover, Mackey defined a physical observable in terms of these basic questions. Mackey's axiom system is somewhat unsatisfactory though, since it assumes that the partially ordered set is actually given as the orthocomplemented closed subspace lattice of a separable Hilbert space. Piron, Ludwig and others have attempted to give axiomatizations that do not require such explicit relations to the lattice of subspaces.", "Von Neumann\u2013Wigner interpretation . In his 1932 book \"The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\", John von Neumann argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows for the collapse of the wave function to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the \"subjective perception\" of the human observer. In 1939, Fritz London and Edmond Bauer argued for the latter boundary (consciousness). In the 1960s, Eugene Wigner reformulated the \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment as \"Wigner's friend\" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line which precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation. See Consciousness and measurement. The non-physical mind is postulated to be the only true measurement apparatus. Rudolf Peierls was also a proponent of this interpretation.", "Henry Stapp . In this book he credits John von Neumann's \"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\" (1955, 1932) with providing an \"orthodox\" quantum mechanics demonstrating mathematically the essential role of quantum physics in the mind. Stapp has taken interest in the work of Alfred North Whitehead. He has proposed what he calls a \"revised Whiteheadianism\".

It was developed in parallel with a new approach to the mathematical spectral theory based on linear operators rather than the quadratic forms that were David Hilbert's approach a generation earlier. Though theories of quantum mechanics continue to evolve to this day, there is a basic framework for the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics which underlies most approaches and can be traced back to the mathematical work of John von Neumann.

One of the best-known early natural experiments was the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak in London, England. On 31 August 1854, a major outbreak of cholera struck Soho. Over the next three days, 127 people near Broad Street died. By the end of the outbreak 616 people died. The physician John Snow identified the source of the outbreak as the nearest public water pump, using a map of deaths and illness that revealed a cluster of cases around the pump.", "1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak . On 31 August 1854, after several other outbreaks had occurred elsewhere in the city, a major outbreak of cholera occurred in Soho. John Snow, the physician who eventually linked the outbreak to contaminated water, later called it \"the most terrible outbreak of cholera which ever occurred in this kingdom.\"", "Soho . A significant event in the history of epidemiology and public health was Dr. John Snow's study of an 1854 outbreak of cholera in Soho. He identified the cause of the outbreak as water from the public pump at the junction of Broad Street (now Broadwick Street) and Cambridge Street (now Lexington Street), close to the rear wall of what is today the John Snow public house.", "1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak . The Broad Street cholera outbreak (or Golden Square outbreak) was a severe outbreak of cholera that occurred in 1854 near Broad Street (now Broadwick Street) in the Soho district of London, England. This outbreak, which killed 616 people, is best known for the physician John Snow's study of its causes and his hypothesis that contaminated water, not air, was the source of cholera. This discovery came to influence public health and the construction of improved sanitation facilities beginning in the mid-19th century. Later, the term \"focus of infection\" would be used to describe sites, such as the Broad Street pump, in which conditions are good for transmission of an infection. John Snow's endeavor to find the cause of the transmission of cholera caused him to unknowingly create a double-blind experiment.", "1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak . Dr Edwin Lankester was a physician on the local research conglomerate that studied the 1854 Broad Street Cholera Epidemic. In 1866, Lankester wrote about John Snow's conclusion that the pump itself was the cause of the Cholera outbreak. He agreed with John Snow at the time; however, his opinion, like Snow's, was not publicly supported. Lankester subsequently closed the pump due to Snow's theory and data on the pattern of infection, and infection rates dropped significantly. Lankester eventually was named the first medical officer of health for the St. James District in London, the same area where the pump was located.", "Cholera outbreaks and pandemics . In 1854, an outbreak of cholera in Chicago took the lives of 5.5% of the population (about 3,500 people). In 1853\u20134, London's epidemic claimed 10,739 lives. The Soho outbreak in London ended after the physician John Snow identified a neighborhood Broad Street pump as contaminated and convinced officials to remove its handle. His study proved contaminated water was the main agent spreading cholera, although he did not identify the contaminant. It would take many years for this message to be believed and acted upon. In Spain, over 236,000 died of cholera in the epidemic of 1854\u201355. The disease reached South America in 1854 and 1855, with victims in Venezuela and Brazil. During the third pandemic, Tunisia, which had not been affected by the two previous pandemics, thought Europeans had brought the disease. They blamed their sanitation practices. Some United States scientists began to believe that cholera was somehow associated with African Americans, as the disease was prevalent in the South in areas of black populations. Current researchers note their populations were underserved in terms of sanitation infrastructure, and health care, and they lived near the waterways by which travelers and ships carried the disease.", "Thematic map . Another example of early thematic mapping comes from London physician John Snow. Though disease had been mapped thematically, Snow\u2019s cholera map in 1854 is the best known example of using thematic maps for analysis. Essentially, his technique and methodology anticipate principles of a geographic information system (GIS). Starting with an accurate base map of a London neighborhood which included streets and water pump locations, Snow mapped out the incidents of cholera death. The emerging pattern centered around one particular pump on Broad Street. At Snow\u2019s request, the handle of the pump was removed, and new cholera cases ceased almost at once.

The two central protagonists are Dr. John Snow, who created a map of the cholera cases, and the Reverend Henry Whitehead, whose extensive knowledge of the local community helped determine the initial cause of the outbreak. Dr. John Snow was a revered anesthetist who carried out epidemiological work in Soho, London. Around the mid-1850s Snow figured out the source of cholera contamination to be the drinking water from the Broad Street pump.  The book was released on 19 October 2006.

Preceding the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak, physicians and scientists held two competing theories on the causes of cholera in the human body.

Darby Lumber Co.\", , which upheld challenged provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Stone also authored the Court's opinion in \"United States v. Carolene Products Co.\", , which, in its famous \"Footnote 4,\" provided a roadmap for judicial review in the post-\"Lochner v. New York\" era.", "Lochner v. New York . The Supreme Court's due process jurisprudence over the next three decades was inconsistent, but it took a narrow view of states' police powers in several major labor cases after \"Lochner\". For example, in \"Coppage v. Kansas\" (1915), the Court struck down statutes forbidding \"yellow-dog contracts.\" Similarly, in \"Adkins v. Children's Hospital\" (1923), the Supreme Court held that minimum wage laws violated the due process clause, but Chief Justice William Howard Taft strongly dissented, suggesting that the Court instead should have overruled \"Lochner\". The doctrine of substantive due process was coupled with a narrow interpretation of congressional power under the commerce clause. Justices James McReynolds, George Sutherland, Willis Van Devanter, and Pierce Butler emerged during the 1920s and 1930s as the foremost defenders of traditional limitations on government power on the Supreme Court, so were collectively dubbed by partisans of the New Deal the \"Four Horsemen of Reaction.\" All four believed in \"laissez faire\" economics.", "Lochner v. New York . The Supreme Court's decision in \"Lochner v. New York\" has been criticized by legal scholars. Law professor Bernard Siegan described it as \"one of the most condemned cases in United States history.\" According to the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, law professors often use \"Lochner\", along with \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" and \"Korematsu v. United States\", as examples of \"how judges should not behave.\"", "J. Warren Madden . During his time on the NLRB, Madden was often opposed by the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which believed that Madden was using the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA; the primary federal law governing labor relations in the U.S.) and the procedures and staff of the NLRB to favor the AFL's primary competitor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). The NLRB and NLRA were under intense pressure from employers, the press, Congressional Republicans, and conservative Democrats. From the time it was established in August 1935, management lawyers had challenged the constitutionality of the NLRA and the authority of the NLRB to act. The Justice Department and NLRB legal staff wanted the Supreme Court to rule as quickly as possible on the constitutionality of the NLRA. But the Board and Justice Department also realized that the Court's \"Lochner\" era legal philosophy made it unlikely that the Court would uphold the Act. Subsequently, Madden strove to resolve minor cases before they could become court challenges, and worked to delay appeals as long as possible until the best possible case could be brought to the Court. The Supreme Court eventually upheld the NLRA in \"National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation\", 301 U.S. 1 (1937), and Madden personally argued the case (along with NLRB General Counsel Charles H. Fahy and Charles Edward Wyzanski, Jr., a special assistant in the office of the United States Solicitor General) before the Court. The ruling marked the Court's abandonment of \"Lochner\" era jurisprudence and led to a series of cases upholding New Deal legislation.", "Cooley v. Board of Wardens . Cooley v. Board of Wardens, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a Pennsylvania law requiring all ships entering or leaving Philadelphia to hire a local pilot did not violate the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.

In comparison, chemists who have obtained a Master of Science (M.S.) in chemistry or in a very related discipline may find chemist roles that allow them to enjoy more independence, leadership and responsibility earlier in their careers with less years of experience than those with a bachelor's degree as highest degree. Sometimes, M.S. chemists receive more complex tasks duties in comparison with the roles and positions found by chemists with a bachelor's degree as their highest academic degree and with the same or close-to-same years of job experience. There are positions that are open only to those that at least have a degree related to chemistry at the master's level. Although good chemists without a Ph. D. degree but with relatively many years of experience may be allowed some applied research positions, the general rule is that Ph. D. chemists are preferred for research positions and are typically the preferred choice for the highest administrative positions on big enterprises involved in chemistry-related duties.

Professors for research universities or for big universities usually have a Ph. D., and some research-oriented institutions might require post-doctoral training. Some smaller colleges (including some smaller four-year colleges or smaller non-research universities for undergraduates) as well as community colleges usually hire chemists with a M.S. as professors too (and rarely, some big universities who need part-time or temporary instructors, or temporary staff), but when the positions are scarce and the applicants are many, they might prefer Ph.

Ras Mikael of Wollo, as he was now known, eventually would marry Shoaregga Menelik, Menelik's natural daughter, becoming the third of his four wives.

In 646, Emperor Taizong sent 22 imperial officials to visit the prefectures throughout the empire, to see how the prefectures were governed. These officials submitted many accusations of misrules against prefects and county magistrates and proposed that those prefects and magistrates be punished. Many of the accused officials submitted appeals to Emperor Taizong, and Emperor Taizong put Chu in charge of reviewing the appeals. Eventually, Emperor Taizong made the final decision to find 20 of the officials innocent and promote them, to find seven severely guilty and execute them, and to give lesser punishments to almost 1,000 others.

There are also instances where the throne is assumed by a younger brother, should the deceased Emperor have no male offspring. By convention in most dynasties, the eldest son born to the Empress (\u5ae1\u9577\u5b50/\u5ae1\u957f\u5b50) succeeded to the throne. In some cases when the empress did not bear any children, the emperor would have a child with another of his many wives (all children of the emperor were said also to be the children of the empress, regardless of birth mother). In some dynasties the succession of the empress' eldest son was disputed, and because many emperors had large numbers of progeny, there were wars of succession between rival sons. In an attempt to resolve after-death disputes, the emperor, while still living, often designated a Crown Prince (\u592a\u5b50). Even such a clear designation, however, was often thwarted by jealousy and distrust, whether it was the crown prince plotting against the emperor, or brothers plotting against each other. Some emperors, like the Yongzheng Emperor, after abolishing the position of Crown Prince, placed the succession papers in a sealed box, only to be opened and announced after his death.", "Emperor Ku .

Liu Zhiyuan, then the military governor of Hedong, initially postured that he would submit to Liao, but then declared himself emperor (of a new state later known as Later Han). With Liu and many others resisting his rule, Emperor Taizong withdrew from the Central Plains region and died on the way back to Liao proper. In the power vacuum, Liu first entered Luoyang, and then headed for Daliang. Dou, along with the other Later Jin officials remaining at Daliang, went to Xingyang (\u6ece\u967d, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan) to welcome him to Daliang, which he subsequently entered. Not long after, Liu requested discussions on how he should establish the imperial temples, in light of the fact that he had claimed ancestry from the Han dynasty imperial clan and honored Emperor Guangwu of Han as a distant ancestor. Dou proposed that it would be appropriate to establish six temples, with Emperor Gao of Han and Emperor Guangwu serving as the two most honored ancestors, and Liu's own four generations of ancestors in the other four temples.

As he saw how the imperial governance had deteriorated under Emperor Yang and believed how many officials who were prior subordinates of his father Yang Su would support him, he plotted to depose Emperor Yang and declaring Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao the Prince of Qin emperor. As he followed Emperor Yang on a campaign against Tuyuhun in 609, he saw how disorganized the Emperor's train was and considered an ambush at that point, but his uncle Yang Shen (\u694a\u614e) dissuaded him from the action.

Many were recorded in detailed biographies in the \"Memoirs of the Historian\" by Sima Qian and the \"Records of the Han\" by Ban Gu. Grand Historian Sima Qian notes that, unlike female wives and concubines, the male companions of the emperors were often admired as much for their administrative abilities as for their sexual abilities: The last of these emperors overlapped chronologically with \"all but one\" of the first fourteen Roman emperors held to be bisexual or exclusively homosexual by historian Edward Gibbon. The Han emperor most strongly devoted to his male companion was Emperor Ai, who \"by nature...did not care for women\", and who attempted to pass the throne on to his lover, Dongxian (\u8463\u8ce2). The story of Emperor Ai which most struck later writers, however, was when the Emperor carefully cut off his sleeve, so as not to awake Dongxian, who had fallen asleep on top of it. The cut sleeve was imitated by many people at court and became known as \"Du\u00e0nxi\u00f9\", or \"breaking the sleeve\".

{"question": "Who co-wrote The Hidden History of the Human Race with a man know devotionally as Drutakarma dasa?", "contexts": ["Richard L. Thompson . Richard Leslie Thompson, also known as Sadaputa Dasa (February 4, 1947 \u2013 September 18, 2008), was an American mathematician, author and Gaudiya Vaishnava religious figure, known principally for his promotion of Vedic creationism and as the co-author (with Michael Cremo) of \"Forbidden Archeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race\" (1993), which has been widely criticised by the scientific community. Thompson also published several books and articles on religion and science, Hindu cosmology and astronomy. He was a member of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (popularly known as the \"Hare Krishna movement\" or \"ISKCON\") and a founding member of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, the branch of ISKCON dedicated to examining the relationship of modern scientific theories to the Vaishnava worldview. In the 'science and religion' community he was known for his articulation of ISKCON's view of science. Danish historian of religion Mikael Rothstein described Thompson as \"the single dominating writer on science\" in ISKCON whom ISKCON has chosen to \"cover the field of science more or less on his own\". C. Mackenzie Brown, professor of religion at Trinity University, San Antonio, Texas, described him as \"the leading figure\" in ISKCON's critique of modern science.", "Pauline Hopkins . \"Of One Blood: Or, The Hidden Self\" tells the story of Reuel Briggs, a medical student who does not care about being black or appreciating African history but finds himself in Ethiopia on an archaeological trip. His motive is to raid the country of lost treasures, which he does find. However, he discovers much more than he expected: the painful truth about blood, race, and the half of his history that was never told. Hopkins wrote the novel intending, in her own words, to \"raise the stigma of degradation from [the Black] race.\" The title, \"Of One Blood\", refers to the biological kinship of all human beings.", "Ingrid Bergman . According to biographer Donald Spoto, she was \"arguably the most international star in the history of entertainment\". After her American film debut in the film \"Intermezzo: A Love Story\" (1939), co-starring Leslie Howard, Hollywood saw her as a unique actress who was completely natural in style and without need of make-up. Film critic James Agee wrote that she \"not only bears a startling resemblance to an imaginable human being; she really knows how to act, in a blend of poetic grace with quiet realism\".", "Haridasa . The Haridasa movement gained further impetus in the 17th and 18th centuries in and around Raichur District. Some of the noted saints from this era were Guru Raghavendra, Vijaya Dasa, Gopala Dasa, Jagannatha Dasa, Prasanna Venkata Dasa, Pranesha Dasa, Venugopala Dasa, Mahipathi Dasa, Mohana Dasa, Helevanakatte Giriamma and Harapanhalli Bhimavva. The history of the Haridasa movement from the 13th century to the present day is the history of spreading \"Hari bhakti\" (devotion to \"Hari\" or Vishnu) to the common man and in that purpose contributed immensely to Kannada literature and to the development of Kannada language. Both the Haridasa and Veerashaiva movements pervade the length and breadth of Karnataka and exert ennobling influences upon the neighboring provinces of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra.", "Dasa . Monier Monier-Williams in 1899, stated that the meaning of \"dasa\" varies contextually and means \"mysterious forces\", \"savages\", \"barbarians\" or \"demons\" in the earliest layer of Vedic literature \u2013 in other contexts, is a self-effacing way to refer oneself as \"worshipper\" or \"devotee aiming to honor a deity\", or a \"servant of god\". In later Indian literature, according to Monier-Williams, usage of \"dasa\" is used to refer to \"a knowing man, or a knower of the universal spirit\". In the latter sense, \"d\u0101sa\" is masculine, while the feminine equivalent is \"d\u0101si\". Some early 20th Century translations, such as P. T. Srinivas Iyengar (1912), translate \"dasa\" as \"slave\".", "History of Protestantism . The frustrated reformism of the humanists, ushered in by the Renaissance, contributed to a growing impatience among reformers. Erasmus and later figures like Martin Luther and Zwingli would emerge from this debate and eventually contribute to another major schism of Christendom. The crisis of theology beginning with William of Ockham in the fourteenth century was occurring in conjunction with the new burgher discontent. Since the breakdown of the philosophical foundations of scholasticism, the new nominalism did not bode well for an institutional church legitimized as an intermediary between man and God. New thinking favored the notion that no religious doctrine can be supported by philosophical arguments, eroding the old alliance between reason and faith of the medieval period laid out by Thomas Aquinas. The major individualistic reform movements that revolted against medieval scholasticism and the institutions that underpinned it were humanism, devotionalism, (see for example, the Brothers of the Common Life and Jan Standonck) and the observantine tradition. In Germany, \"the modern way\" or devotionalism caught on in the universities, requiring a redefinition of God, who was no longer a rational governing principle but an arbitrary, unknowable will that cannot be limited. God was now a ruler, and religion would be more fervent and emotional. Thus, the ensuing revival of Augustinian theology, stating that man cannot be saved by his own efforts but only by the grace of God, would erode the legitimacy of the rigid institutions of the church meant to provide a channel for man to do good works and get into heaven. Humanism, however, was more of an educational reform movement with origins in the Renaissance's revival of classical learning and thought. A revolt against Aristotelian logic, it placed great emphasis on reforming individuals through eloquence as opposed to reason. The European Renaissance laid the foundation for the Northern humanists in its reinforcement of the traditional use of Latin as the great unifying language of European culture.", "Forbidden Archeology . Forbidden Archeology: The Hidden History of the Human Race is a 1993 book by Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompson, written in association with the Bhaktivedanta Institute of ISKCON. Cremo states that the book has \"over 900 pages of well-documented evidence suggesting that modern man did not evolve from ape man, but instead has co-existed with apes for millions of years!\", and that the scientific establishment has suppressed the fossil evidence of extreme human antiquity. Cremo identifies as a \"Vedic archeologist\", since he believes his findings support the story of humanity described in the Vedas. Cremo's work has garnered interest from Hindu creationists, paranormalists, and theosophists. He says a knowledge filter (confirmation bias) is the cause of this suppression.", "Salvation in Christianity . Shortly after 1100, Anselm, appointed as archbishop of Canterbury, wrote a classic treatise about atonement. In it he puts forward the \"satisfaction theory\" of the atonement in salvation. Humanity's offense of rebellion against God is one that demands a restitution or satisfaction. Fallen humanity is incapable of making adequate satisfaction. Nevertheless, such is God's love that God will not simply abandon us to the consequences of our sins. Anselm wrote, \"This debt was so great that, while none but man must solve the debt, none but God was able to do it; so that he who does it must be both God and man.\" The suffering of Christ, the God-man who is God's only son, pays off what human beings owe to God's honor, and we are thereby reconciled to God. So God took human nature upon himself so that a perfect human might make perfect satisfaction and so restore the human race. His foundational work is seen later in Calvinism and Arminianism.", "History of the Catholic Church and homosexuality . In his last personal work, \"Memory and Identity\", published in 2005, John Paul II he referred to the \"pressures\" on the European Parliament to permit \"homosexual 'marriage'\".

Swaminarayan is believed to be physically manifest in the murti, and several arti ceremonies are performed throughout the day, allowing devotees to show their devotion.

Since acquiring the rights to \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" library, SOFA Entertainment has catalogued, organized and cleared performance rights for the original shows. Starting in 1991, SOFA Entertainment has re-introduced \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" to the American public by producing numerous network specials, half-hour series (airing on TV Land, PBS, VH1 and Decades) and home video compilations. Some of these compilations include \"The 4 Complete Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Beatles\", \"All 6 Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Rolling Stones\", \"Elvis: The Ed Sullivan Shows\", \"Motown Gold from the Ed Sullivan Show\", \"Ed Sullivan's Rock 'n Roll Classics\", and 115 half-hour \"The Best of The Ed Sullivan Show\" specials, among others.

According to Ray Manzarek, network executives asked that the word \"higher\" be removed. The group appeared to acquiesce, but performed the song in its original form, because either they had never intended to comply with the request or Jim Morrison was nervous and forgot to make the change (Manzarek has given conflicting accounts). Either way, \"higher\" was sung out on national television, and the show's host, Ed Sullivan, canceled another six shows that had been planned. After the program's producer told the band they would never play on the show again, Jim Morrison reportedly replied: \"Hey man. We just \"did\" the Sullivan Show.\"", "The Ed Sullivan Show . Chris Griffin (formerly with the trumpet section of Harry James, Ziggy Elman and Chris Griffin of The Benny Goodman Band) was Ray Bloch's lead trumpet player for the many radio and television shows that he conducted, including the \"Ed Sullivan Show\". \"Chris\" remained the lead trumpet player with \"The Ed Sullivan show\" from the first show in 1948 to the last show in 1971. Milton Schlesinger was a percussionist who similarly played from the first to last show. John Serry Sr. often augmented the orchestra as the lead accordionist during the 1950s. Unlike NBC's \"The Tonight Show\", which celebrated the notoriety of their musicians in Skitch Henderson's or Doc Severinsen's \"Tonight Show Band\", the CBS producers of \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" decided to hide their famed musicians behind a curtain. Occasionally, CBS would broadcast specials and call upon the orchestra to perform. When Robert Kennedy was assassinated, music was hastily composed for the orchestra in a special tribute that also featured Bill Evans, who had recently composed an Elegy To His Father.

There are however types of SR connectors that do not resemble their American counterpart.", "Category 5 cable . Cable types, connector types and cabling topologies are defined by TIA/EIA-568-B. Nearly always, 8P8C modular connectors (often referred to as RJ45 connectors) are used for connecting category\u00a05 cable. The cable is terminated in either the T568A scheme or the T568B scheme. The two schemes work equally well and may be mixed in an installation so long as the same scheme is used on both ends of each cable.", "Optical fiber cable . The buffer or jacket on patchcords is often color-coded to indicate the type of fiber used. The strain relief \"boot\" that protects the fiber from bending at a connector is color-coded to indicate the type of connection. Connectors with a plastic shell (such as SC connectors) typically use a color-coded shell. Standard color codings for jackets (or buffers) and boots (or connector shells) are shown below:", "Stage pin connector . Though the initial cost of constructing a 12/3 stage pin extension cable is higher than simply purchasing an equivalent Edison extension cable, the maintenance costs of the former are ultimately lower for several reasons. To begin with, less maintenance will be required as a result of the more rugged construction. When maintenance is required, many cable faults may be repaired by disassembling the connector, replacing broken components with spares acquired by cannibalizing other broken connectors, trimming away defective sections of cable, and reapplying the connector to the cable. This sort of repair is not usually possible with Edison connectors, particularly the factory-molded type. If a connector is beyond repair, a new stage pin connector is often less expensive than a replacement Edison connector when purchased from local vendors.", "Loudspeaker . With sound reinforcement system, PA system and instrument amplifier speaker enclosures, cables and some type of jack or connector are typically used. Lower- and mid-priced sound system and instrument speaker cabinets often use 1/4\" speaker cable jacks. Higher-priced and higher powered sound system cabinets and instrument speaker cabinets often use Speakon connectors. Speakon connectors are considered to be safer for high wattage amplifiers, because the connector is designed so that human users cannot touch the connectors.", "RS-232 . Since the standard definitions are not always correctly applied, it is often necessary to consult documentation, test connections with a breakout box, or use trial and error to find a cable that works when interconnecting two devices. Connecting a fully standard-compliant DCE device and DTE device would use a cable that connects identical pin numbers in each connector (a so-called \"straight cable\"). \"Gender changers\" are available to solve gender mismatches between cables and connectors. Connecting devices with different types of connectors requires a cable that connects the corresponding pins according to the table below. Cables with 9 pins on one end and 25 on the other are common. Manufacturers of equipment with 8P8C connectors usually provide a cable with either a DB-25 or DE-9 connector (or sometimes interchangeable connectors so they can work with multiple devices). Poor-quality cables can cause false signals by crosstalk between data and control lines (such as Ring Indicator).", "Audio and video interfaces and connectors . Some of these connectors, and other types of connectors, are also used at radio frequency (RF) to connect a radio or television receiver to an antenna or to a cable system; RF connector applications are not further described here. Analog A/V connectors often use shielded cables to inhibit radio frequency interference (RFI) and noise.", "S-Video . The four-pin mini-DIN connector is the most common of several S-Video connector types. The same mini-DIN connector is used in the Apple Desktop Bus for Macintosh computers and the two cable types can be interchanged. Other connector variants include seven-pin locking \"dub\" connectors used on many professional S-VHS machines, and dual \"Y\" and \"C\" BNC connectors, often used for S-Video patch panels. Early Y/C video monitors often used phono (RCA connector) that were switchable between Y/C and composite video input. Though the connectors are different, the Y/C signals for all types are compatible.", "Digital Signal 3 . DS3 interconnect cables must be made with true 75-ohm coaxial cable and connectors. Cables or connectors which are 50 ohms or which significantly deviate from 75 ohms will result in signal reflections which will lower the performance of the connection, possibly to the point of not working. GR-139-CORE, \"Generic Requirements for Central Office Coaxial Cable\", defines type 734 and 735 cables for this application. Due to losses, there are differing distance limitations for each type of cable. Type 734 has a larger center conductor and insulator for lower losses for a given distance. The BNC connectors are also very important as are the crimping and cable stripping tools used to install them. Trompeter, Cannon, Amphenol, Kings, and Canare make some of the true 75 ohm connectors known to work. RG-6 or even inexpensive RG-59 cable may work temporarily when properly connectorized, though it does not meet telephony technical standards.

Research has demonstrated when school aged children (3-7 yrs. Of age) are given the choice of choosing milk or sweetened beverages at lunch time, they tend to choose the sweetened beverages. This has major health implications for children, as nutrition is essential for proper development. Studies have shown sugar sweetened beverages displace important nutrients such as iron and calcium which result in deficiency-related conditions. For example, iron deficiency can result in nerve impulse delay. Children who do not consume the appropriate amount of calcium into their daily diets have lower calcium consumption as they get older. In contrast, as they get older, their intake of sugary beverages increases. Many children grow to have a level of intolerance to milk and another significant percentage grow to not like the taste of milk.[6] Insufficient levels of calcium throughout adolescence is a precursor for osteoporosis and even obesity in some cases. Maternal consumption of milk can influence children's consumption. A study of 9 year old girls and calcium consumption reported those who met the average recommended intake (AI) for calcium consumed almost twice as much milk and less sweetened beverages (18%) had mothers who drank milk more frequently than those who were under the AI for calcium.", "Functional beverage . Health experts are concerned about the increased consumption and popularity of functional beverages. Although these beverages may serve to hydrate the individual, they may not mitigate or even address today's major health issues, such as obesity, heart disease, and cancer.

Clotaire's son Dagobert I (died 639), who sent troops to Spain and pagan Slavic territories in the east, is commonly seen as the last powerful Merovingian King. Later kings are known as \"rois fain\u00e9ants\" (\"do-nothing kings\"), despite the fact that only the last two kings did nothing. The kings, even strong-willed men like Dagobert II and Chilperic II, were not the main agents of political conflicts, leaving this role to their mayors of the palace, who increasingly substituted their own interest for their king's. Many kings came to the throne at a young age and died in the prime of life, weakening royal power further.", "Saloum . Although the Kingdom won some major battles against the French, it was later defeated. However, like the Kingdom of Sine, the royal dynasty survived up to 1969, when the last king of Saloum, Fode N'Gouye Joof had died. His year of death corresponded with the death of Maad a Sinig Mahecor Joof, who was king of Sine. These two kings were the last Serer kings and the last kings of the Senegambia. After their deaths, both Kingdoms were incorporated into the new Republic of independent Senegal which gained its independence in 1960. Thus the Kingdom of Sine and the Kingdom of Saloum were the last pre-colonial kingdoms of Senegambia to have survived up to the 20th century.", "Kapisa (city) . Obviously, the affinities of the early Shahis of Kapisa/Kabul are still speculative, and the inheritance of the Kushan-Hephthalite chancery tradition and political institutions by Kabul Shahis do not necessarily connect them to the preceding dynasty i.e. the Kushanas or Hephthalites. From the 5th century to about 794 AD, their capital was Kapisa, the ancient home of the cis-Hindukush Kambojas \u2013 popularly also known as Ashvakas. After the Arab Moslems began raiding the Shahi kingdom, the Shahi ruler of Kapisa moved their capital to Kabul (until 870 AD). Alberuni's accounts further claim that the last king of the early Shahiya dynasty was king Lagaturman (Katorman) who was overthrown and imprisoned by his Brahmin vizier called Kallar. Alberuni's reference to the Brahman vizier as having taken over the control of the Shahi dynasty, in fact, may be a reference to Kallar (and his successors) as having been followers of Brahmanical religion in contrast to Shahi Katorman (Lagaturman) or his predecessors Shahi rulers, who were undoubtedly staunch Buddhists. It is very likely that a change in religion may have been confused with change in dynasty. In any case, this started the line of so-called \"Hindu Shahi\" rulers, according to Alberuni's accounts.", "Qocho .

In addition, one ancient inscription and several ancient Buddhist manuscripts from the Gilgit area between upper Indus and river Kabul shed some light on the three kings who ruled in the Gilgit region in the 6th and 7th centuries AD. They also bore Shahi titles and their names are mentioned as \"Patoladeva alias Navasurendradiyta Nandin\", \"Srideva alias Surendra Vikrmadiyta Nandin\" and \"Patoladeva alias Vajraditya Nandin\". It is very relevant to mention here that each of the Shahi rulers mentioned in the above list of Gilgit rulers has Nandin as his surname or last name It is more than likely that the surname Nandin refers to their clan name. It is also very remarkable that the modern Kamboj tribe of northern Punjab still has \"Nandan (Nandin)\" as one of their important clan names. It is therefore very likely that these Gilgit rulers of upper Indus may also have belonged to the Kamboja lineage. Furthermore, \"Shahi, Sahi, Shahiya\" as a septal name is still carried by a section of the Punjab Kambojs which appears to be a relic from the Shahi title of their Kabul/Kapisa princes.", "List of last scions .

In Babylon, the battle was acted out at the royal court with the king playing Marduk, and his son-rescuer as Nabu, the god of writing. Once freed from the powers of the underworld, the king would enact the rite of the Sacred Marriage on the 10th day of the ceremony. During this rite, the king (or En, as he was known in Sumer) would perform sexual intercourse with his spouse, normally a high priestess who had been chosen from among the \"naditum\", a special class of priestesses who had taken a vow not of celibacy precisely, but of a refusal to bear children. The high priestess was known as the \"entu\", and her ritual act of intercourse with the king was thought to regenerate the cosmos through a reenactment of the primordial coupling of the cosmic parents An and Ki, who had brought the world into being at the dawn of Time. If an eclipse of the sun fell on any of the 12 days of the ceremony, a substitute for the king was put in his place, since it was thought that any evils which might have befallen the king would accrue to the substitute instead. On the last day of the festival, the king was slain so that he could battle at Marduk's side.
