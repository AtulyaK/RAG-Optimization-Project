One context in which the existence of further facts is debated is that of personal identity across time: in what sense is Alice today really the \"same\" person as Alice yesterday, given that across the two days the state of her brain is different and the atoms that constitute her are different? One may believe that at bottom, there is nothing more than the atoms and their arrangement at different points in time; while we may for practical purposes come up with some notion of sameness of a person, this notion does not reflect anything deeper about reality. Under this view there would be no further facts. Alternatively, one may believe that there is a deeper sense in which Alice yesterday and Alice today really are the same person. For example, if one believes in Cartesian souls, one may believe that Alice yesterday and Alice today are the same person if and only if they correspond to the same soul. Or one may not believe in Cartesian souls, but yet believe that whether Alice yesterday and Alice today are the same person is a question about something other than facts about which atoms constitute them and how they are arranged. These would both be further-fact views. The debate about further facts about personal identity over time is most closely associated with Derek Parfit. In his \"Reasons and Persons\", he describes the non-reductionist's view that \"personal identity is a deep further fact, distinct from physical and psychological continuity\". Parfit takes a reductionist stance and argues against this further-fact view. As a result it is not clear whether a person has any reason to be worried about her future self in a special way that does not also apply to worrying about others, with Parfit arguing that it is plausible that \"only the deep further fact gives me a reason to be specially concerned about my future\" (his so-called \"Extreme Claim\"). Sydney Shoemaker objects that it is not clear how a further fact would give a reason for such special concerns, either. Harold Langsam has attempted to give a positive account of how a further fact would give such a reason. David Chalmers lists a number of other types of candidates for further facts. One is facts about conscious experience. For example, it is difficult to see how it follows from the physical facts what it is like to experience seeing red; indeed, inverted spectrum scenarios, where we imagine that experiences of colors are swapped without anything else changing, might suggest that things could have been different without the physical facts changing. Another candidate for a further fact is the fact that there is any conscious experience at all, rather than everyone being a philosophical zombie. Christopher Hill and Brian Mclaughlin have argued against the idea that facts about consciousness are further facts, disputing the logical possibility of a world physically identical to ours in which the facts about consciousness are different."], "ground_truth": "a compromise on biblical inerrancy", "answer": "The Creation Science Association, associated with Carl Wieland, believes anything other than the young Earth view is a compromise on biblical inerrancy."}

It was in the early 1990s that the console role-playing video game genre distinguished itself greatly from computer RPGs, with the \"Final Fantasy\" series playing an instrumental role. \"Final Fantasy III\" introduced the \"job system\", a character progression engine allowing the player to change a character's class, as well as acquire new and advanced classes. \"Final Fantasy IV\" (1991) was one of the first role-playing games to feature a complex, involving plot, placing a much greater emphasis on character development and pioneering \"the whole concept of dramatic storytelling in an RPG.\" It also introduced a new battle system: the \"Active Time Battle\" system, developed by Hiroyuki Ito, where the time-keeping system does not stop. Square Co., Ltd. filed a United States patent application for the ATB system on March 16, 1992, under the title \"Video game apparatus, method and device for controlling same\" and was awarded the patent on February 21, 1995. On the battle screen, each character has an ATB meter that gradually fills, and the player is allowed to issue a command to that character once the meter is full. The fact that enemies can attack or be attacked at any time is credited with injecting urgency and excitement into the combat system. Both the \"job system\" and the ATB system were fully developed in \"Final Fantasy V\" (1992) and continued to be used in later \"Final Fantasy\" games as well as other Square games such as \"Chrono Trigger\" (1995). \"Final Fantasy VI\" (1994) and the \"Megami Tensei\" series were some of the first RPGs to move away from the typical medieval setting, with \"Final Fantasy VI\" instead being set in a steampunk environment and the \"Megami Tensei\" games set in modern-day Japan.", "Final Fantasy XIII . As in \"Final Fantasy XII\", enemies are integrated into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen similar to those used in previous \"Final Fantasy\" titles. A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional Active Time Battle (ATB) system first featured in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Under this system, the player selects an action from the menus, such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI).

The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six. The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically.

Designed by Hiroyuki Ito, it injected urgency and excitement into combat by requiring the player to act before an enemy attacks, and was used until \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\", which implemented the \"Conditional Turn-Based\" (CTB) system. This new system returned to the previous turn-based system, but added nuances to offer players more challenge. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\" adopted a real-time battle system where characters continuously act depending on the issued command. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\" continued this gameplay with the \"Active Dimension Battle\" system. \"Final Fantasy XIII\"s combat system, designed by the same man who worked on \"X\", was meant to have an action-oriented feel, emulating the cinematic battles in \"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\".

The relative importance of each loss process is a function of the planet's mass, its atmosphere composition, and its distance from its sun. One non-thermal escape mechanism is atmospheric stripping by a solar wind in the absence of a planetary magnetosphere. Excess kinetic energy from solar winds can impart sufficient energy to the atmospheric particles to allow them to reach escape velocity, causing atmospheric escape. The solar wind, composed of ions, is deflected by magnetic fields because the charged particles within the wind flow along magnetic field lines. The presence of a magnetic field thus deflects solar winds, preventing the loss of atmosphere. On Earth, for instance, the interaction between the solar wind and earth's magnetic field deflects the solar wind about the planet, with near total deflection at a distance of 10 Earth radii. This region of deflection is called a bow shock.", "Geophysics . If a planet's magnetic field is strong enough, its interaction with the solar wind forms a magnetosphere.

{"question": "When was the first stud book created for the breed of horse that came from Rotrou introducing Arabian horses to Perche?", "contexts": ["Percheron . Arabian stallions were made available to Percheron breeders for use in breeding army mounts, beginning in 1760 at the royal stud at Le Pin. Between 1789 and the early 1800s, the Percheron was in danger of becoming extinct as horse breeding was suppressed during the French Revolution and its aftermath. Early histories of the breed point to two gray Arabian stallions from Le Pin, Godolphin and Gallipoly, as the blood that helped to restart Percheron breeding. However, later research found that Godolphin was a chestnut Arabian of ordinary conformation and no special worth, while Gallipoly was a gray saddle horse of unknown breeding. Modern breed historians contest that there was enough breeding stock left after the early 19th century to restart the breed without further Arabian influence, and state that it is unlikely that two horses of unremarkable breeding and conformation had a significant influence on the breed. Jean le Blanc, a founding stallion of the Percheron breed, was foaled in 1823. Today, all Percherons trace their ancestry to this stallion. At this time the breed also became larger, with horses from other French districts being imported to Perche to change the Percheron from a coach horse averaging to a draft horse averaging . In 1893, the first Percheron stud book was created in France. By 1910, French registrations had risen to almost 32,000 horses. Between 1880 and 1920, Percheron breeders in France exported horses all over the world, including South Africa, South America, Australia and North America.", "Tersk Stud . Arabians were re-introduced to the new Tersk Stud in 1925 and the first French Arabian imports arrived in 1930. These included the stallion Kann and six mares, most notable of which was Carabine. Koheilan IV was imported from Hungary. The French horses had generally good conformation but were lacking Arabian type, so the stud\u2019s managers searched for quality breeding stock with the characteristic Arabian refinement. In 1936, a shipment of 25 horses came from Crabbet Arabian Stud in England, some of which were descended from horses that had lived at the Stroganov and Shcherbatov stud and perished during the revolution. There were six stallions in the purchase, of which Naseem (a son of Skowronek and great-grandson of Mesaoud) was the most influential. Among the mares, Rissalma, Rixalina, and Star of the Hills left a significant impression on the breed. Tersk attempted to purchase Skowronek himself from Crabbet Stud, but he was not for sale.", "Percheron . The Percheron breed originated in the Huisne river valley in France, which arises in Orne, part of the former Perche province, from which the breed gets its name. Several theories have been put forth as to the ancestry of the breed, though its exact origins are unknown. One source of foundation bloodstock may have been mares captured by from the Bretons some time after 496 AD, and another may have been Arabian stallions brought to the area by Muslim invaders in the 8th century. Other possibilities are captured Moorish cavalry horses from the Battle of Poitiers in 732 AD, some of which were taken by warriors from Perche. A final theory posits that the Percheron and the Boulonnais breed are closely related, and that the Boulonnais influenced the Percheron when they were brought to Brittany as reinforcements for the legions of Caesar. It is known that during the 8th century, Arabian stallions were crossed with mares native to the area, and more Oriental horse blood was introduced by the Comte du Perche upon his return from the Crusades and expeditions into territory claimed by Spain. Blood from Spanish breeds was added when Rotrou III imported horses from Castile. No matter the theory of origin, breed historians agree that the terrain and climate of the Perche area had the greatest influence on the development of the breed. A possible reference to the horse is made in the 13th-century romance \"Guillaume de Dole\", in which the title character asks for \"the Count of Perche's horse\" to be made ready, possibly indicating the \"'great horse,' which could accommodate an armored knight\" and was bred in the geographical setting of the poem."], "ground_truth": "1883", "answer": "The first Percheron stud book was created in France in 1893."}

{"question": "What produces the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron?", "contexts": ["Aldosterone . Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon. It plays a central role in the homeostatic regulation of blood pressure, plasma sodium (Na), and potassium (K) levels. It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume. When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease. Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart.", "Urinary system . Aldosterone plays a central role in regulating blood pressure through its effects on the kidney. It acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron and increases reabsorption of sodium from the glomerular filtrate. Reabsorption of sodium results in retention of water, which increases blood pressure and blood volume. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is a neurohypophysial hormone found in most mammals. Its two primary functions are to retain water in the body and vasoconstriction. Vasopressin regulates the body's retention of water by increasing water reabsorption in the collecting ducts of the kidney nephron. Vasopressin increases water permeability of the kidney's collecting duct and distal convoluted tubule by inducing translocation of aquaporin-CD water channels in the kidney nephron collecting duct plasma membrane.", "Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion . The normal function of ADH on the kidneys is to control the amount of water reabsorbed by kidney nephrons. ADH acts in the distal portion of the renal tubule (Distal Convoluted Tubule) as well as on the collecting duct and causes the retention of water, but \"not\" solute. Hence, ADH activity effectively dilutes the blood (decreasing the concentrations of solutes such as sodium), causing hyponatremia; this is compounded by the fact that the body responds to water retention by decreasing aldosterone, thus allowing even more sodium wasting. For this reason, a high urinary sodium excretion will be seen."], "ground_truth": "zona glomerulosa", "answer": "Aldosterone."}

The quality and importance of Big Bone Lick as a fossil site rivals that of the similarly aged Rancho La Brea tar pits.

In July 1739 a French military expedition comprising 123 French soldiers and 319 Native American warriors left Quebec under the command of Charles Le Moyne, Baron de Longueuil to help defend New Orleans from the Chickasaw, who were attacking the city on behalf of England. While on their journey down the Ohio River towards the Mississippi, they camped in what is now Kentucky. Some of the expeditions Native members formed a hunting party and embarked to acquire that evening's meal. When they returned that evening their canoes were laden with massive fossils including long tusks, massive teeth, and a thighbone almost as tall as a person. The source of their fossils was the site now known as Big Bone Lick. This find is considered the first major scientifically documented fossil discovery in American vertebrate paleontology. Near the end of 1740, Baron Charles de Longueuil departed from New Orleans to France, carrying with him fossils from Big Bone Lick. Longueuil left a large femur, three molars, and a tusk at the Cabinet du Roi. The Cabinet du Rois was a collection of curiosities stored in the chateau of the king's botanical garden. In 1756, mineralogist Jean-Etienne Guettard published a scientific paper in Paris, France with two illustrations of one of the molars Longueuil brought from Big Bone Lick to France.

African slaves also contributed their knowledge; the first reasonably accurate recorded identification of vertebrate fossils in the new world was made by slaves on a South Carolina plantation who recognized the elephant affinities of mammoth molars uncovered there in 1725. The first major fossil discovery to attract the attention of formally trained scientists were the Ice Age fossils of Kentucky's Big Bone Lick.

The psilocybin molecule is indirectly responsible for the hallucinogenic properties of the \"Psilocybe\". This compound, as well as all other indole alkaloids, are derived from the amino acid tryptophan, being the only amino acid with the indole-amine ring. Tryptophan is converted to tryptamine by decarboxylation. Two methylation steps occur producing DMT, another psychedelic compound. Hydroxylation of this compound produces the more potent hallucinogen psilocin, followed by phosphorylation yielding psilocybin. After ingestion of the psilocybin compound alkaline phosphatases present in the body's digestive system, kidneys, and possibly in the blood readily cleave the phosphoryl ester bond from psilocybin, yielding the hydroxyl compound, psilocin. Psilocin is the chemical primarily responsible for the hallucinogenic effects of the \"Psilocybe\". The blue-staining species of \"Psilocybe\" are characterized by the presence of psilocin and psilocybin. This blue-staining reaction occurs after the fruit body has been injured, particularly near the base of the stalk.

It is common to consider any tragedy containing an element of revenge a revenge tragedy.

A revenge tragedy can also be any tragedy where revenge is, more or less, a minor part of the overall narrative, rather than a narrative's major driving force. As long as revenge is an underlying theme or motivation throughout the piece, it can be labeled as a revenge tragedy. For example, John Webster's \"The Duchess of Malfi\" (c.1613), while often classified as a tragedy (originally was marketed as \"The Tragedy of the Dutchesse of Malfy\"), can also be classified or read as a revenge tragedy, since both major and minor characters are motivated by revenge.

In 1959, the Gonzalez family sold part of their land in Do\u00f1ana for development of the Matalasca\u00f1as resort. This alarmed European conservationists, leading various institutions and anonymous donors to offer to buy part of the property. Valverde, Hoffman, and Nicholson, in partnership with the British Nature Conservancy, formed an association that organised an international drive for funds to expand the park. The campaign raised two million Swiss Francs to buy 7,000 hectares of land for annexation to that already donated by Gonz\u00e1lez-Gordon. Finally, in 1963 the Spanish government and WWF bought part of the territory and created the first Do\u00f1ana preserve, and in 1964 they established the Do\u00f1ana Biological Station and the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas - CSIC) to study the biodiversity of Do\u00f1ana and other Spanish ecosystems.

The director had also seen numerous productions of \"Swan Lake\", and he connected the duality of the White Swan and the Black Swan to the script. When researching for the production of \"Black Swan\", Aronofsky found ballet to be \"a very insular world\" whose dancers were \"not impressed by movies\".

In this book, he expounded and enhanced his humanistic view on sexual ethics and morality and dedicated a chapter on homosexuality to giving homosexuals advice and suggestion on how to more greatly enjoy and enhance their sexual love lives. While preserving some of the ideas about human sexuality from the original, the revision described his later humanistic opinions and ethical ideals as they had evolved in his academic work and practice.", "Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women . Wittenberg wrote that the book was certain to become an instant classic and that it fully deserved this status. Morin described the book as a \"long-awaited publication\", but did not consider its authors' findings surprising. He wrote that Bell and Weinberg appeared to have found \"difficulty in dealing with the diversity of experiences that they found among their gay respondents\". While appreciating Bell and Weinberg's attempts to discredit stereotypes about homosexuals, he found their division of homosexuals into different \"types\" to be in effect the creation of a new set of stereotypes. He called Bell and Weinberg's typology of homosexuals \"arbitrary and misleading.\" He argued that while the book was a \"fine historical document\", its data only reflected the situation in San Francisco in 1969 and 1970. He denied that Bell and Weinberg had a representative sample, and suggested that a representative sample of homosexuals was impossible given that they were \"basically an invisible population\". He also accused Bell and Weinberg of drawing \"conclusions well beyond their data.\" While he considered \"Homosexualities\" a helpful work, and useful on a political level, he did not consider it \"a sophisticated research study\". He wrote that the book was \"disappointing and consistent with the downward trend in the quality of reports emanating from the Institute for Sex Research\", and criticized Bell and Weinberg for ignoring \"issues of growth and the ways in which diversity may lead to insights which might be helpful to all men and women exploring the creative violation of sex roles.\"", "Sex and Reason . Anderson described the book as \"ambitious\", and wrote that it \"contains much to please and enrage people on all sides of the issues considered\" and was \"often brilliant, but occasionally obtuse\". He credited Posner with providing an erudite review of the \"literature on the biology, history, philosophy, psychology, and sociology of sex\", and with making a generally compelling argument that much of the variance in sexual behavior and customs across cultures and eras is explained by a handful of factors. He predicted that because of its author's influence, the book would be widely cited in legal briefs, especially but not only by civil libertarians, and wrote that it demonstrated considerable courage because it was likely to alienate his conservative supporters. He suggested that homosexuality plays a central role in the book, and credited Posner with establishing that sexual orientation is unchosen, \"may well be biologically determined\", and is unchangeable. However, he believed that the book would have benefited from applied research, and that Posner presented an incomplete analysis of sex. He found Posner's data on sexuality to be of disappointing quality, writing that he had made insufficient efforts to \"obtain demographic data on sexual minorities, and lesbians in particular\". He also predicted that some of his theoretical analysis would be controversial, especially those concerning abortion and infanticide, and that some of his conclusions about homosexuality were incorrect. He criticized Posner for implying that conventionally masculine men are necessarily heterosexual, for asserting that not only European countries, but also Latin American countries, the Philippines, and Japan are significantly more tolerant of homosexuality than the United States, for his treatment of rape, which he considered unclear and debatable in its conclusions about rapists' motives, and his treatment of the issue of whether prostitution should be legalized, which he found inconsistent. He criticized Posner for failing to \"articulate a theory of the appropriate role for criminal penalties as opposed to other regulatory actions\", which he believed would have helped Posner to reach unambiguous conclusions, the details of Posner's economic analysis, his arguments against welfare programs, and his discussion of same-sex marriage."], "ground_truth": "Edmund Valentine White III", "answer": "Albert Ellis."}

Anna May Wong was the first Asian American to have become an international acting star. She became a fashion icon during the silent film era, beginning with her success in the film \"The Toll of the Sea\" (1922), the first color feature to be made in Hollywood. During her career she sought roles that portrayed Chinese and Asian Americans in a positive light, but these films never became famous except for a select few such as the film \"Daughter of Shanghai\" (1937). Frustrated by being stereotyped and typecast during her career in the United States, she moved to Europe, where she appeared in many plays and films, the most notable of which was the British film \"Piccadilly\" (1929). She later returned to the United States in an ironic twist, at a time when American studios were searching Europe for fresh new talent, despite the fact that she is an American. She returned with promises of leading roles, but these did not come about due to racism in the United States. She eventually stopped acting in professional films and turned to stage, cabaret, B movies, and anti-Japanese propaganda films such as \"Bombs Over Burma\" (1943) due to her being an advocacy against the Japanese aggression in China. She was set to make her comeback with the film \"Flower Drum Song\" (1961) but was unable due to failing health.

He became the first male sex symbol of Hollywood long before and the precursor to Rudolph Valentino. His fame rivaled that of Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin. His fame began during the silent film era, leading into sound pictures in his later life. He became a film actor in a somewhat reluctant and accidental manner when the famous producer Thomas Ince saw his theatre play \"The Typhoon\" and wanted to turn it into a silent film and when it was released the film was an instant hit. With rising stardom he was eventually offered film contract by Famous Players-Lasky now Paramount Pictures. His second film with the production company, \"The Cheat\" (1915), was a success and made him a romantic hit with U.S. female audiences. He became a leading man of romance films, considered a heartthrob and a sex symbol; many actresses wanted to work with him in films, in which he was often cast as the exotic male Asian lover that women desired. After years of being typecast as a villain and exotic Asian lover that white women could not have, he decided to start his own production company, where he eventually made 23 films; he produced, starred in, and directed them, and contributed to their design, writing and editing. His films also influenced the way the United States viewed Asians. He personally chose American actress Marin Sais to appear opposite him in his films such as \"The City of Dim Faces\" and \"His Birthright\". Hayakawa's collaboration with Sais ended with the film \"Bonds of Honor\" (1919). In 1919, Hayakawa made what is generally considered one of his best films, \"The Dragon Painter\". After some bad business, he left the United States and for the next 15 years he worked in Europe and Japan where he made many popular films and plays such as the films \"The Great Prince Chan\" and the play \"Samurai\" which he performed for the king and queen of the United Kingdom at that time King George V and Queen Mary and a stage play version of \"The Three Musketeers\".

The book was an instant success and remains popular. Perrault's \"Histoires\" has had considerable impact on world culture.

{"question": "Who was the last king of the Shahiya?", "contexts": ["Kapisa (city) . Obviously, the affinities of the early Shahis of Kapisa/Kabul are still speculative, and the inheritance of the Kushan-Hephthalite chancery tradition and political institutions by Kabul Shahis do not necessarily connect them to the preceding dynasty i.e. the Kushanas or Hephthalites. From the 5th century to about 794 AD, their capital was Kapisa, the ancient home of the cis-Hindukush Kambojas \u2013 popularly also known as Ashvakas. After the Arab Moslems began raiding the Shahi kingdom, the Shahi ruler of Kapisa moved their capital to Kabul (until 870 AD). Alberuni's accounts further claim that the last king of the early Shahiya dynasty was king Lagaturman (Katorman) who was overthrown and imprisoned by his Brahmin vizier called Kallar. Alberuni's reference to the Brahman vizier as having taken over the control of the Shahi dynasty, in fact, may be a reference to Kallar (and his successors) as having been followers of Brahmanical religion in contrast to Shahi Katorman (Lagaturman) or his predecessors Shahi rulers, who were undoubtedly staunch Buddhists.

It is very relevant to mention here that each of the Shahi rulers mentioned in the above list of Gilgit rulers has Nandin as his surname or last name It is more than likely that the surname Nandin refers to their clan name. It is also very remarkable that the modern Kamboj tribe of northern Punjab still has \"Nandan (Nandin)\" as one of their important clan names. It is therefore very likely that these Gilgit rulers of upper Indus may also have belonged to the Kamboja lineage.
